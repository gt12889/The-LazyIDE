/* managerSignals.ts — derivation of the LazyManager rail's "live signals"
   feed (cockpit2 orchestrator upgrade), plus a persisted acknowledgment
   layer on top of it.

   Two owner-requested behaviors share ONE mechanism here:

   - QUESTION RELAY: a running mission's pending ask_user question should
     surface in the manager rail with an inline answer + quick
     Autoriser/Refuser buttons (traces AttentionInbox.tsx's 'question' kind
     — same extractPendingQuestionText-sourced signal, exposed fleet-wide as
     FleetMission.pendingQuestion by fleetMissions.ts).
   - PROACTIVE SIGNALS: when a mission enters review/failed, or a new
     question appears, the manager should post ONE concise line with real
     action buttons (Merger/Diff/Réessayer) — debounced, no spam.

   Design choice for "debounced, one line per event, no spam": rather than
   an ever-growing timeline of one-shot notifications (which needs its own
   dedup/expiry bookkeeping to avoid spam), a ManagerSignal is recomputed
   fresh from the CURRENT fleet snapshot every poll (deriveManagerSignals
   itself has no memory of its own) and keyed by `id` = `${kind}:${missionId}`.
   React's keyed reconciliation then gives the "one line per open event"
   property for free: the SAME mission staying urgent across polls renders
   the SAME bubble (no duplicate append), and a mission leaving its urgent
   state (answered/merged/retried) simply stops appearing next poll — no
   explicit "mark as seen"/expiry state to maintain, and nothing here can
   ever fabricate or accumulate stale entries. This mirrors
   AttentionInbox.tsx's own model (a live, source-of-truth-recomputed list),
   just re-skinned as manager-chat-style bubbles for the rail.

   Reuses cockpitHelpers.ts's rankUrgentMissions (the SAME classification
   already driving the AGENTS zone's urgent cards) instead of duplicating
   urgency logic — a mission is only ever "urgent" in one place.

   ARCHIVED MISSIONS (real user report fix): rankUrgentMissions/classifyUrgent
   (cockpitHelpers.ts) classify a mission purely from its status, with no
   `archived` check — an old failed/review mission the user archived (R13
   lifecycle, Mission.archived) kept generating the exact same signal forever
   since `project.missions` still includes it. deriveManagerSignals now drops
   an archived mission before classification, same as the Agent Canvas
   reconciler already does for the board itself.

   ACKNOWLEDGMENT (real user report fix, "j'ai des trucs échoués que je ne
   peux jamais supprimer donc ça pollue" — 29 stacked signals, some for
   missions that never resolve): deriveManagerSignals stays a pure function
   of its inputs (existing callers/tests are unaffected), but a signal is
   only ever "urgent" as long as its underlying mission stays in that exact
   state — an old failed mission the user isn't going to retry re-emits the
   SAME `id` (`${kind}:${missionId}`) every poll forever, with no way to say
   "I've seen this, stop showing it". useAcknowledgedSignals below adds a
   persisted (localStorage), per-id acknowledgment set alongside the pure
   derivation: `visibleManagerSignals` filters a signal list down to the
   ones NOT acknowledged. Acknowledging a signal only ever hides THAT exact
   (kind, missionId) pair — if the mission later changes status (e.g.
   failed -> retried -> review), its id changes too, so the new state's
   signal is unacknowledged and correctly resurfaces; this is not a
   permanent per-mission mute, it's a per-EVENT dismissal, exactly like
   closing a single notification.
