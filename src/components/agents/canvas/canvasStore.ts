/* canvasStore.ts — zustand v5 + zundo temporal store (W1a, plan §W1a).

   Owns ONLY canvas geometry + the UI-authored facts layered on top of the
   real read-models (spec §3 data ownership rule, canvasTypes.ts's header):
   node positions, viewport, collapsed project zones, prefs, drafts, chains,
   notes. NEVER a second source of truth for mission state — the reconciler
   (reconciler.ts) is the only place FleetMission/FleetProject facts meet
   this store's geometry.

   This is the FIRST zustand store in the repo (spec §12: "zustand ...
   canvas-scoped only — repo stays hand-rolled Context elsewhere") — no
   existing local convention to mirror beyond zundo's own docs
   (node_modules/zundo/README.md).

   Undo/redo (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z, spec §5) covers ONLY user edits:
   positions, drafts, chains, notes, collapsed. `viewport` (pan/zoom) and
   `hydrate()` (loading persisted state at startup/project switch) are
   EXCLUDED from history:
     - viewport is excluded via zundo's `partialize` (it is simply not part
       of the tracked slice) combined with an `equality` check — panning/
       zooming alone never changes the tracked slice, so no history entry
       is pushed for it (see the "Prevent unchanged states from getting
       stored in history" recipe in zundo's README).
     - hydrate() additionally wraps its `set()` call in
       `temporal.pause()`/`resume()` — even though it DOES change the
       tracked slice (loading fresh positions/drafts/chains/notes), it must
       never itself become an undoable step (undoing right after a hydrate
       would revert to the pre-hydrate default state, which is never what
       the user means by "undo").

   Exports both the vanilla store (`canvasStoreVanilla` — for non-React
   callers: canvasPersistence.ts's autosave subscriber, W4's manager
   executor, tests) and React hooks (`useCanvasStore`, `useCanvasTemporal`)
   per the plan's W1a deliverable.
