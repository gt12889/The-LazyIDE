     - useCanvasAutoComposition.ts's dev-server auto-detect (a background
       probe that auto-adds a preview once a project's dev server answers).
     - the LazyManager's start_preview action (agentsStore.tsx) — an
       explicit, user-requested "show me the site" action.
   Extracted here once so neither reimplements the reuse-vs-create check.

   Preview lifecycle fix ("linked to the agents/missions working on it"):
   also owns `findRunningMissionRef`, the "which mission does this preview
   belong to" resolution BOTH callers need to populate `SurfaceSpec.ownerRef`
   (reconcilerEdges.ts's `buildSurfaceEdges` only draws the dotted
   surface-edge when it is set) — extracted for the exact same
   don't-reimplement-it-twice reason as the reuse-vs-create check above.

 * (`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`'s `devUrl`), wrongly attributed to a project
 * that never served anything there). Root cause: `useCanvasAutoComposition
 * .ts`'s candidate-port fallback probe (CANDIDATE_DEV_PORTS, which includes
 * 5173, Vite's default) only ever asked "does ANYTHING answer on this port"
 * — a `no-cors` fetch can't read the response body/headers to check WHOSE
 * server it is, so it never verified the answering server actually belongs
 * to the project being probed. While the IDE itself runs in dev mode (this
 * app's own WebView is loaded FROM that exact devUrl), every open project's
 * background probe was racing against — and losing to — the app's own
 * dev server the instant nothing else answered on that port first.
 *
 * This is the one honest, verifiable guard available without reading the
 * (opaque, no-cors) response: never adopt a candidate url that is literally
 * this running app's OWN origin. `currentOrigin` is the caller's
 * `window.location.origin` (injected so this stays a pure, unit-testable
 * function with no DOM dependency of its own) — in a real Tauri dev session
 * this is exactly the devUrl the WebView loaded from; in a packaged build it
 * is a custom scheme (`tauri://localhost`/`asset://...`) that can never
 * collide with a `http://localhost:*` preview candidate, so this is a pure
 * no-op there. A malformed/incomparable url never throws — degrades to "not
 * self", the safe direction (never silently blocks a legitimate preview).
