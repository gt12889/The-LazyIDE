/* canvasProposalCleanup.ts — hydrate-time migration for stale/mis-homed
   plan-proposal previews.

   Root cause this repairs (real founder state, 2026-08-01/02): a
   `generate_plan` proposal that is never launched nor rejected used to
   survive on the canvas FOREVER, across app restarts — nothing ever swept
   it. Separately, a plan proposed while the WRONG project happened to be
   active materialized its whole preview graph INSIDE that project's zone
   (see agentsStore.tsx's `generate_plan` case for the forward fix). Live
   repro: 49 stale draft nodes from 5 un-launched proposals, 3 of them
   stacked inside a single zone that did not target them at all — read by
   the founder as "the graph got duplicated".

   This module ONLY ever touches nodes still carrying `proposedPlanId` —
   canvasStore's `acceptProposedSteps` clears that stamp the instant a step
   is accepted (see its own doc comment), so a node still tagged is BY
   CONSTRUCTION never a real, launched mission. Nothing here can ever touch
   a launched mission, a chain between real missions, or anything else
   already materialized.

   ── INCIDENT (2026-08-02): the FIRST version of `inferReHomeTarget`
   matched on a bare project BASENAME ("does the objective mention the
   word 'site'/'LazySite-internet'?"). Deployed live, it swept 33+16
   drafts — INCLUDING an already-correctly-homed 11-node plan — into a
   project literally named `lazygt`, because every objective in this
   product naturally contains the word "lazygt" ("finir le backoffice de
   lazygt", "améliorer le site vitrine de lazygt") and there is an open
   project with that exact name. A false re-home is WORSE than the
   accumulation it was meant to fix — a preview that LOOKS re-homed but
   is not the real target would launch missions against the wrong repo.
   Two fixes, both load-bearing:
     1. `inferReHomeTarget` no longer matches on a project NAME at all —
        only on the target's real, absolute ROOT PATH appearing verbatim
        in the objective/name text (see that function's own doc comment).
        A product name can never collide with a filesystem path.
     2. Re-home is OFF BY DEFAULT (`CleanupStaleProposalsDeps.enableReHome`,
        defaults to `false` when omitted) — the real production wiring
        (useCanvasHydration.ts's `makeProposalCleanupDeps`) does not set
        it. The two-tier staleness cleanup below (missing/advanced
        orchestrator) is unaffected and stays fully active.
   The already-mis-relocated orchestrators from that incident were NOT
   auto-reverted: this module never recorded a `movedFrom` field, so
   there is no reliable signal to distinguish "moved by the bug" from
   "always lived here" — guessing a second time to undo a guess is the
   same mistake twice. They are left for the founder to reject
   ("Rejeter", proven working) and re-ask, which now lands correctly
   (generate_plan's own target-project fix).

   Two-tier staleness criterion (SAFE — silence/ambiguity never deletes):
     - `getOrchestrator` returns nothing for the planId -> the orchestrator
       record itself is gone -> definitely stale -> preview removed
       (`rejectProposedPlan` — the exact primitive the "Rejeter" button
       already uses).
     - the orchestrator EXISTS but its `status` is no longer 'planning' ->
       it already moved on (executing/done/blocked) WITHOUT ever properly
       clearing this preview's `proposedPlanId` stamp (acceptProposedSteps
       never ran for it) -> the preview fell out of sync with the real plan
       and is stale ghost data, same treatment as the missing-orchestrator
       case.
     - orchestrator EXISTS and is still 'planning' -> a real, still-pending
       proposal (possibly resumed after a restart — chat history and
       orchestrators.json both persist) -> LEFT ALONE, UNLESS:
         (a) the STALE-PROPOSAL sweep below fires (age or same-project
             duplicate), or
         (b) re-home is explicitly enabled (`enableReHome: true`, opt-in
             only — see the INCIDENT note above) AND `inferReHomeTarget`
             finds an absolute-path match (module header on that
             function) — the preview is then moved into its real
             project's zone (`retagProposedPlanProject` + relocating the
             underlying orchestrator record so a later execute_plan runs
             against the correct repo too), never silently left
             half-correct.
     - the proposal's CURRENT projectId cannot be resolved to an open
       project's root at all (not open this session) -> UNKNOWN, never
       guessed away -> LEFT ALONE (the caller re-runs this whenever the
       open-project list changes, so it still gets cleaned once
       resolvable).

   ── STALE-PROPOSAL SWEEP (2026-08-04 — real founder state: 21 orphaned
   drafts from plans re-proposed several times, each generate_plan call
   minting a BRAND NEW orchestrator/planId rather than updating the last
   one, all still 'planning' forever with no manager-side way to clear any
   of them — see types.ts's `reject_plan` action, the retroactive manual
   counterpart of this same cleanup). Two ADDITIONAL, UNCONDITIONAL
   criteria — never gated by `enableReHome`, exactly like the two-tier
   staleness above, applied to whatever is STILL 'planning' after it:
     - AGE: the orchestrator's own `createdAt` is older than
       `STALE_PROPOSAL_AGE_MS` (24h) -> genuinely abandoned, never
       launched nor rejected in a full day -> preview removed
       (`rejectProposedPlan`), reason `'proposal-stale'`.
     - DUPLICATE: among whatever survives the age sweep, more than one
       still-'planning' proposal targets the SAME projectId -> only the
       single MOST RECENTLY CREATED one is kept; every older sibling is
       removed, reason `'proposal-superseded'`. A projectId with only one
       live proposal is never touched by this rule — it is a
       "re-proposed several times" rule, never a "one plan per project,
       period" rule.
   Both criteria read `createdAt` only (never `updatedAt`) — a proposal
   that was genuinely revised (`revise_plan`) while still 'planning' is a
   rarer case this module does not attempt to distinguish from "created
   long ago, never touched again"; see `isProposalAgeStale`'s own doc
   comment for why `createdAt` is still the safer, simpler signal.
