/* useCanvasHydration.ts — mount-time data feeds for the Agent Canvas (W2b
   refactor of CanvasView.tsx — deliverable #0). Bundles two orthogonal but
   both mount-time concerns that used to live inline in CanvasView.tsx's
   body:
     - the persistence boot (load `canvas/layout.json` + `canvas/chains.json`
       ONCE, hydrate canvasStore, decide fitView vs a persisted viewport,
       wire the autosave subscription) — see canvasPersistence.ts's own
       header for the full seam description; behavior copied verbatim from
       CanvasView.tsx's original mount effect;
     - the scheduled-agents poll (agent-template cron triggers, refreshed
       every 30s while the canvas is visible) — reconciler.ts's own
       "SEAM for W1c" comment.
   Grouped together only because both are "gather a real-time INPUT the
   reconciler needs, from an effect, at mount" — not because they depend on
   each other.

 * `activeRoot` value on every render never re-triggers the boot.
 *
 * ── BUG 1 fix (W6f, real-app P0 data-loss repro) ──────────────────────
 * The original version of this effect SKIPPED hydration entirely when
 * `activeRoot` was still null at mount (a common cold-boot race — the
 * project registry hydrates async) but armed the debounced autosave
 * subscription (canvasPersistence.ts's `subscribeCanvasAutosave`)
 * unconditionally regardless. The very next store change then wrote the
 * pre-hydrate EMPTY store over the real global canvas/{layout,chains}.json
 * files — observed live going from 2 drafts + 1 chain to nothing.
 *
 * Three changes close this:
 *   (a) hydrate unconditionally with respect to `activeRoot` — never
 *       skipped for lack of an active root, ON TAURI. `repoPath` is only
 *       ever consulted by canvasPersistence.ts for the one-time LEGACY
 *       per-project migration (its own module header: storage itself has
 *       been GLOBAL, via canvas_state_load/save, since W3) — so a null root
 *       at mount is no longer a reason to skip loading the real global
 *       state, only a reason to skip the migration lookup (passing ''
 *       already means exactly that to loadCanvasPersisted).
 *   (b) ...but NOT unconditionally with respect to PLATFORM: outside Tauri
 *       there is no real global file to protect (every canvasPersistence.ts
 *       load/save already short-circuits to defaults/no-op there), and
 *       canvas-harness.tsx's screenshot fixture pre-seeds canvasStoreVanilla
 *       directly, relying — by its own doc comment — on hydrate() never
 *       running outside a real Tauri boot to clobber that seed with empty
 *       defaults. Gating on `isTauriPlatform()` rather than `activeRoot`
 *       keeps that contract intact while still fixing the ACTUAL bug, which
 *       only ever happens on a real (Tauri) boot.
 *   (c) the autosave subscription is only ever CREATED after boot() has
 *       actually run hydrate() on the store — never armed early "just in
 *       case", so there is no window where a store change could be
 *       persisted before the real data has replaced the store's defaults.
 * `isHydrated` is still threaded into subscribeCanvasAutosave as a second,
 * independent signal (canvasPersistence.ts's own empty-overwrite guard) —
 * belt-and-suspenders, not load-bearing given (a)-(c) above, but cheap
 * insurance against a future change re-introducing an early-arm path.
