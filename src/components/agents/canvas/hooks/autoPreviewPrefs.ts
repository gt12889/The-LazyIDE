/* autoPreviewPrefs.ts — W-UX3 core deliverable 3a: "dismissable + remembered
   prefs" for the dev-server auto-detect preview (useCanvasAutoComposition.ts).

   A tiny localStorage-backed map, keyed by projectId — once a user closes an
   AUTO-ADDED preview node for a project (PreviewNode.tsx's close button,
   only when `data.autoAdded` is true), that project is remembered as
   "don't auto-add again" for `DISMISS_TTL_MS`. A manually-added preview's
   close button never touches this (see the `autoAdded` gate at the one call
   site) — only the automatic suggestion itself is dismissable, never a real
   user action.

   Preview lifecycle fix: this used to be a PERMANENT, one-way blacklist (a
   flat array of dismissed projectIds, no expiry) — closing one dead/
   misplaced auto-added card (a stale port, a probe that raced a restart)
   silently stopped ALL future auto-suggestions for that project forever,
   with no way back short of manually clearing localStorage. A TTL keeps the
   real intent ("don't immediately re-suggest what I just closed") honest
   without that permanence — the value is now a dismissal timestamp, not a
   boolean, and `isAutoPreviewDismissed` treats an expired one as "not
   dismissed" again. A pre-fix (array-shaped) blacklist is migrated in
   `readDismissedMap` as "just dismissed now" rather than dropped outright —
   still honored for one fresh TTL window, never silently discarded.

   Best-effort like every other localStorage read/write in this app (see
   i18n/index.tsx's own try/catch convention) — a private-browsing/quota
   failure degrades to "never remembered, would re-suggest next session",
   never a thrown error.
