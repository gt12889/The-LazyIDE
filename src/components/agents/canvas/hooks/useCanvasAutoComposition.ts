/* useCanvasAutoComposition.ts â€” W-UX3 core deliverable 3: "AUTO-COMPOSITION"
   ("tout doit Ãªtre fait automatiquement comme il faut", dismissable +
   remembered prefs). Three related, all mission-status-transition-driven
   behaviors, kept in one file because they share the same "diff this
   render's fleet against the previous one" scaffolding:

   (a) dev-server auto-detect â€” while a project has a running mission,
       ensures its dev server is actually running (P46+P48 â€” package.json
       `scripts.dev` + port heuristic, reuse-if-already-up, spawn via the
       real PTY infra otherwise; see lib/agents/devPreview.ts) and, once a
       URL answers, auto-adds a preview node to that zone, ONCE (never
       re-added if the user dismisses it â€” see autoPreviewPrefs.ts). Falls
       back to polling a short list of common dev-server ports when no
       detectable Node dev script exists (a non-Node project, or a
       package.json this heuristic can't confidently parse) â€” the original
       passive behavior, kept for that case.

       2026-08-05 foreign-server-adoption incident fix, layered on top of
       that passive fallback (see `tick()`'s own inline comments for the
       full mechanics): (i) a project whose own scripts.dev or static
       deliverable resolves (or whose real orchestration is only
       transiently blocked - `getDevServerSkipReason`) NEVER reaches the
       passive candidate-port loop at all - real incident: it attributed
       project "lazygt-real-test" a preview at localhost:3000 that was
       actually a DIFFERENT open project's (lazy-backoffice) Next.js dev
       server, only because 3000 answered and wasn't this app's own self
       origin; (ii) even in the genuine last resort (no scripts.dev, no
       worktree-scoped deliverable), a reachable candidate is
       content-fingerprinted (devPreview.ts's `contentFingerprintMatches` +
       `defaultFetchBodyStart`) against the project's own root index.html,
       when one resolves, before ever being adopted.
   (b) work auto-focus â€” when a mission transitions to running and at most
       2 missions are running fleet-wide, gently PAN (never rezoom, never
       mid-gesture â€” see the 5s idle gate below) so the node is on screen,
       but ONLY if it is currently fully off-viewport; already-visible work
       is left completely alone.
   (c) mission-complete flash + preview refresh â€” a mission transitioning
       to 'done' gets a transient `focus-flash` highlight (the SAME CSS
       class useCanvasFlowGraph.ts's own `justMergedId` already drives â€”
       reused here with the CORRECT ref-keyed id set rather than Cockpit's
       own `justMergedId`/`highlightIds`, which are built from bare mission
       ids and therefore never actually match a canvas node's `id`
       (`mission:<id>`) â€” a pre-existing, unrelated mismatch flagged
       separately, not fixed here to keep this wave's blast radius
       contained), and any preview surface already open in that project's
       zone gets its reachability probe re-armed (PreviewNode.tsx's
       `refreshRequestedAtMs` wiring) â€” "the site updates before your
       eyes".

   Perf note: this hook only re-derives its transition detection when
   `projects` changes (a real fleet update, already the cadence the rest of
   the canvas re-renders at) â€” no polling loop runs unless a project
   genuinely has running work, and each such loop is a single lightweight
   `no-cors` fetch (the same technique PreviewNode.tsx's own reachability
   probe already uses) on a handful of candidate ports, never a busy loop.
