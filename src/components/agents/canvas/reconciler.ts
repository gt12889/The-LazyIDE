/* reconciler.ts — FleetProject[] + canvas geometry -> React Flow nodes/edges
   (W1a, plan §W1a; spec §6). PURE functions only: no React, no I/O. Every
   export here is unit-testable by constructing plain data and asserting on
   the returned { nodes, edges }.

   Mission/agent FACTS come from the existing read-models (FleetMission,
   FleetProject — spec §3 data ownership rule); this module only DERIVES
   React Flow node/edge shapes from them plus the canvas store's geometry
   (positions/collapsed/prefs) and canvas-owned facts (drafts/chains/notes).
   It never mutates any of its inputs.

   ── W9 SPLIT (this file was 1146 lines) ── the pipeline is now three
   cohesive sibling modules plus this orchestrator, which stays the SOLE
   public barrel every external caller imports from (production code AND
   tests) — no import path outside this file needed to change:
     - reconcilerZones.ts — per-zone child collection, incremental
       placement, bounding-box sizing, shelf-packing, referential-stability
       reuse. Owns `CanvasReactFlowNode`.
     - reconcilerFold.ts — orchestrator subtree fold (hidden-mission
       closure, chain-edge reroute target, sub-mission badge aggregate) +
       loop expand-in-place (iteration mini nodes). Owns `MissionLoopMeta`.
     - reconcilerEdges.ts — hierarchy/chain/iteration edge building. Owns
       `CanvasReactFlowEdge`.
   See each file's own header for its slice of the pipeline. ZERO behavior
   change from the pre-split version — every function body moved verbatim.

   ── CONTRACT GAPS found while implementing (canvasTypes.ts is frozen —
   these are worked around locally in the sub-modules above, not fixed
   upstream; see this wave's report for the full writeup) ──

   1. FleetMission (src/lib/agents/fleetMissions.ts), the read-model
      MissionNodeData/LoopNodeData embed verbatim, does NOT carry
      loopConfig / loopParentId / loopIteration / parentMissionId /
      isOrchestrator — only the full `Mission` type does. Loop aggregation
      and hierarchy edges (spec §6) are therefore impossible from
      `FleetProject[]` alone. Worked around via an optional
      `missionLoopMeta` side-map (keyed by mission id, reconcilerFold.ts's
      `MissionLoopMeta`) that {@link ReconcileInputs} accepts in addition to
      the plan's shorthand input list. Absent entries degrade to "plain
      mission node, no loop, no hierarchy edge" — never a crash, never a
      silently dropped mission.

   2. canvasTypes.ts's header comment (spec §6 excerpt) mentions
      `sched:<scheduleId>` as the schedule node's ref prefix, but
      `CanvasNodeKind` only contains the literal `'schedule'` — confirmed
      with the orchestrator: the prose is stale, `schedule:<scheduleId>`
      (via `makeRef('schedule', id)`) is the actual contract, which is what
      this file uses.

   3. `ChainEdgeData` (condition/disabled/tombstone/firing) is NOT part of
      canvasTypes.ts's frozen `Chain` model (which only covers the
      PERSISTED chain: id/sourceRef/targetRef/condition/createdBy/
      disabled) — W1b defined the canonical render-time shape in
      `edges/ChainEdge.tsx` (their file, not W1a's) and reconcilerEdges.ts
      imports it from there per orchestrator arbitration, rather than
      defining its own competing shape. `firing` (true for exactly the
      tick a chain fires) is derived from `Chain.lastFiredAtMs` — W3's
      chain engine owns setting that.

   4. `MissionNodeData.forceApprove` and `ProjectNodeData.isActive` /
      `MissionNodeData.isActiveProject` / `LoopNodeData.isActiveProject`
      need Cockpit's local `forceApproveIds` set and
      `AppContext.activeProjectId` — neither appears in the plan's input
      shorthand either. Added as optional `forceApproveIds` /
      `activeProjectId` fields on {@link ReconcileInputs} (default to
      "none active" / empty set) for the same reason as gap 1.
