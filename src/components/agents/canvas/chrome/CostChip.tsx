/* CostChip.tsx — per-mission live cost chip (canvas cost visibility wave).

   Extracted into its own file rather than added to chrome/nodeChrome.tsx
   (already at 815 lines, over this repo's 800-line file-size ceiling — see
   that file's own header comment) so this addition never pushes an
   already-oversized shared module further over budget. Mirrors
   nodeChrome.tsx's MetaChip/ModelTierChip footprint and conventions (same
   font-mono/10.5px chip shell, same warning-amber palette VerdictChip
   already uses) so it reads as part of the same visual family despite
   living in a sibling file.

   fix/canvas-cost-credits (David's measured repro, 2026-08-14: a
   claude-haiku-4-5 mission — routed on the user's OWN Claude CLI
   subscription — showed "$0.07") — the owner's standing rule, already
   established elsewhere in this codebase (types.ts's
   ManagerMessage.proposal.estimatedCreditsByModel doc comment, item 7 fix:
   "the owner's standing rule is credits per model, never a dollar figure,
   and an explicit 'no credits charged' statement whenever the run actually
   goes through a CLI subscription rather than managed/Pro credits") was
   never applied to this PER-MISSION chip, only to the plan-proposal
   estimate. `costUsd` here is real, exact spend either way (agentMetrics)
   — but which UNIT is honest to show depends on which rail actually paid
   for it: `runtime.ts`'s `classifyMissionModel(model)` is the SAME
   dispatch-time classification the run itself was routed through (never a
   second guess) — 'native' (no '/', not a BYOK provider id) means the
   user's own Claude CLI subscription, the one rail this product's rule
   says incurs ZERO lazygt debit; every other rail (managed/byok) converts the
   real spend into credits using `usdToCredits` (billing/credits.ts — the
   single "1 credit == 1 USD cent" conversion every credits display in this
   app now shares, this module's own former private copy included).

   2026-08-19 dollar-kill incident follow-up: the native branch below used
   to hide the number entirely (just the "no debit" pill) — it now shows the
   SAME credits-equivalent number MissionNode.tsx's liveMetricsLabel chip
   shows right next to it (both converted via the one shared usdToCredits),
   worded as a non-debited EQUIVALENT rather than omitted, so the two chips
   never contradict each other (one used to imply a real amount while the
   other said "no debit" — the exact flagged inconsistency).
