/* geometry.ts — single source of truth for the Agent Canvas's placement
   grid, zone chrome, and lane-mode geometry (W6b geometry fix wave).

   Before this file, reconciler.ts (zone/child placement) and layout.ts
   (elkjs zone packing + lane layout) each independently duplicated the
   SAME pixel values "by convention" (see layout.ts's prior header comment
   for the rationale — avoiding a reconciler -> layout import cycle, since
   layout.ts already imports FROM reconciler.ts for its node/edge types).
   That convention is exactly how the values drifted out of sync with the
   ACTUAL rendered card size (nodeChrome.tsx's NodeCard had no fixed
   width/max-height at all), which is the root cause of the W6b geometry
   bugs: overlapping zones, overlapping full cards at zoom >= ZOOM_COMPACT,
   a zone tint box too small for its own children, and a lane mode with no
   real lane width.

   This module breaks that cycle instead of perpetuating it: plain
   numeric/derived exports only, zero React, zero imports from
   reconciler.ts/layout.ts/canvasTypes.ts — safe for reconciler.ts's own
   "pure functions only: no React, no I/O" contract, and importable from
   nodeChrome.tsx (a React module) without creating a cycle either.

   fix/canvas-title-band-zoom — the one exception is `./chrome/lod.ts`: a
   leaf module with zero imports of its own (never imports FROM this file,
   so no cycle), holding the LOD screen-size-compensation constants/
   functions every zoom-adaptive element on the canvas shares. Importing its
   {@link ZONE_TITLE_BAND_TARGET_PX}/`LOD_FLOOR_ZOOM` here single-sources
   the title band's worst-case math (below) instead of duplicating the "44"
   and "0.1" as a second, driftable magic number in this file.

 *  prior attempt at this fix (see HISTORY below) reserved a gap INSIDE the
 *  frame, below the header and above row 0, and grew that reservation every
 *  time a new repro landed. That approach never actually closes the bug: a
 *  child's position can be a STALE persisted value from before whatever
 *  reservation existed at the time it was saved (`reconcilerZones.ts`'s own
 *  hard rule, "an existing position is NEVER moved"), so growing the
 *  reserved band can never retroactively fix an already-placed card that
 *  sits inside the new, bigger band. `nodes/ProjectGroupNode.tsx`'s zone
 *  title (name + its identity row: running-count chip, approval-mode
 *  badge) no longer lives INSIDE this frame at all — it's rendered as a
 *  separate, absolutely-positioned label floating ABOVE the frame's own top
 *  edge (`canvas-zone-header`'s `position: absolute; bottom: calc(100% +
 *  gap)`, anchored to the frame's own top-left) — see that file's own doc

 *  regress the same way again: nothing rendered INSIDE the frame's own
 *  rectangle can ever occupy the same pixels as a label that isn't
 *  geometrically part of that rectangle, regardless of any stale/legacy
 *  child position.
 *
 *  This constant's OLD job — capping how tall the header could grow
 *  INSIDE the frame — no longer exists (there is no header inside the
 *  frame to cap). It is kept at a small, honest value (rather than deleted)
 *  purely as the last few pixels of top content-inset `gridSlotPosition`
 *  adds on top of `ZONE_HEADER_HEIGHT` below — see that function's own
 *  call site: children now start at `ZONE_HEADER_HEIGHT +
 *  ZONE_TITLE_BAND_HEIGHT` = 36, filling the box from very near its real
 *  top, instead of the previous 440px dead gap this fix removes.
 *
 *  The title's own WORST-CASE flow-space footprint (this constant's old
 *  reason to be 404) still exists and still needs guarding against — just
 *  against a DIFFERENT hazard now: the title floats OUT of its own frame

 *  whatever sits in THAT space (another zone's own bottom edge), not this
 *  zone's own children. That worst-case number now lives in {@link
 *  ZONE_TITLE_MAX_FLOW_HEIGHT} below, sized identically (`TARGET / LOD_FLOOR_ZOOM`)
 *  but consumed by the inter-zone vertical-spacing guard ({@link

 *  grown to cap the header's OWN in-frame LOD-driven height growth — see
 *  `chrome/lod.ts`'s `titleBandHeight`) -> this (fix/canvas-title-float:

 * protecting against — the exact feedback loop behind the reported defect.
 *
 * `zoneSameRowPackGap` breaks that loop for the actual same-row packing
 * advance (`packAutoPlacedZones`'s/`layoutAll`'s own cursorX step) by sizing
 * the gap against THIS zone's own REAL name length (never the generic
 * 40-char ceiling — "espacement proportionne au contenu reel": a zone named
 * "lazygt" needs far less clearance than one with a 40-char name) — still
 * clamped at {@link ZONE_TITLE_TYPICAL_MAX_NAME_CHARS} for a pathologically
 * long name, same "permitted pathological case" trade-off that constant's
 * own doc comment already accepts — evaluated at {@link
 * ZONE_SPACING_PRACTICAL_ZOOM} (0.5) instead of the absolute zoom floor: the
 * same zoom this fix's own acceptance target aims to keep "fit" at for a
 * couple of modest zones, a self-consistent choice (guard titles down to the
 * zoom real multi-project browsing should still land on, not the technical
 * minimum a user could theoretically drag the wheel to).

 * `ARRANGE_MIN_READABLE_ZOOM` (0.35, the fit's own readability floor) for no
 * real reason — "one constant, the zoom people actually use", not two
 * numbers that happen to both mean roughly that. Lowered 0.5 -> 0.35 to
 * match it (duplicated as a value, not a cross-import — `cameraInsets.ts`
 * lives one layer up and already documents this same "duplicate the
 * constant, not the module dependency" convention this file's own header
 * uses for `layout.ts`/`reconcilerZones.ts`). Still used by
 * `zoneMinWidthForTitle` below (the per-zone WIDTH floor) — the packing
 * GAPS themselves ({@link ZONE_PACK_HORIZONTAL_GAP}/{@link ZONE_VERTICAL_GAP}

 * scratch/_canvas-label-design.md §3.1/§3.3 — retired the NAME-LENGTH-
 * proportional same-row packing gap this constant's own history describes
 * below, in favor of one small flat constant. Two things changed together
 * to make that safe:
 *   1. `ProjectGroupNode.tsx`'s round-2 "geometric containment" fix
 *      (`canvas-zone-header`'s outer `maxWidth: width` + `overflow: hidden`,
 *      unchanged by this design) already guarantees a title can NEVER paint
 *      past its own zone's own right edge, at any zoom, by construction — a
 *      title-vs-neighbour collision the old proportional gap existed to
 *      prevent is now geometrically impossible regardless of gap size.
 *   2. The compensation itself is now BOUNDED (chrome/lod.ts's
 *      `LOD_FLOOR_ZOOM`, 0.1 -> 0.25, "the tldraw model") — even the title's
 *      own WORST-CASE flow-space reach shrank from ~4048px
 *      (`ZONE_TITLE_MAX_FLOW_WIDTH` at the old floor) to a small fraction of
 *      that, so the old gap's entire premise (a title's on-screen width can
 *      balloon without bound as zoom approaches the floor) no longer holds.
 * A flat, small, purely-visual breathing gap between two packed zone boxes —
 * same job {@link ZONE_GAP} does for the lane gutter, just for the zone-to-
 * zone same-row packing advance instead. Kept as a function (not a bare
 * constant) so `reconcilerZones.ts`'s `packAutoPlacedZones`/`layout.ts`'s
 * `layoutAll`/`migrateBloatedZoneRowPositions` keep their existing call
 * shape — the `zoneName` parameter is now unused (kept for that same
 * call-site stability, not because the gap still depends on it).
 *
 * HISTORY: this used to scale with a zone's own real name length, evaluated
 * at {@link ZONE_SPACING_PRACTICAL_ZOOM} (P2-16 fix, replacing an even
 * bigger flat worst-case gap sized against the technical zoom floor) —
 * "espacement proportionne au contenu reel". Superseded here: containment
 * (point 1 above) made proportional sizing unnecessary, and the bounded
 * compensation (point 2) made the old worst-case math moot even as a
 * fallback.

/**
 * fix/canvas-zone-title-clip (David's measured repro, round 3 of the
 * floating-title saga, real packaged app: with the round-2 "geometric
 * containment" fix live — `ProjectGroupNode.tsx`'s outer `canvas-zone-
 * header` clamped to `maxWidth: width` + `overflow: hidden` — all 8 zone
 * headers read `uc`, `La`, `uc`, `uc`, `laz`, `La`, `La`, `de`: 2-3
 * characters, no ellipsis, every zone indistinguishable). Root cause: CSS
 * `overflow: hidden` on an ancestor clips a transformed descendant's
 * PAINTED (post-`transform: scale`) extent, not its pre-transform layout
 * size — the SAME reason {@link ZONE_TITLE_RESERVED_NAME_CHARS}'s own doc
 * comment gives for why a flow-space CSS width bound "would itself get
 * multiplied by that same scale factor ... the opposite of bounded", just
 * not yet applied to this OUTER box. At low zoom the identity cluster's
 * `lodScale` factor is large (up to 9.2x at {@link LOD_FLOOR_ZOOM}), so a
 * typical zone's modest flow-space width survives only `zoneWidth /
 * scaleFactor` pre-scale flow px — a handful of px, mostly consumed by
 * fixed chrome, leaving 2-3 characters for the name.
 *
 * David's own requirement (verbatim): "a header must never paint outside
 * its zone AND must stay identifiable ... the zone's own width has to
 * accommodate a usable name at the zoom levels people actually use ... the
 * answer is likely in the layout (minimum zone width / how zones are
 * packed), not in ever-tighter clipping of the label." This function is
 * that layout fix: the per-zone minimum WIDTH (flow px) needed so THIS
 * zone's own real name (clamped at {@link ZONE_TITLE_RESERVED_NAME_CHARS}
 * — the header's own established truncation cap; a name longer than that
 * already truncates with a MIDDLE ellipsis via `lib/truncateMiddle.ts`, so
 * sizing past the cap would waste canvas space no header ever uses) fits
 * inside the outer clip's own budget WITHOUT triggering it — evaluated at
 * {@link LOD_FLOOR_ZOOM}, the technical zoom FLOOR (CanvasView's own
 * `minZoom` derives from that same constant, so it is the worst case a user
 * can actually REACH).
 *
 * fix/canvas-zone-title-full-at-floor (David, live app at 26% zoom:
 * "la moitié des noms des zones dans le canva sont coupés" — every zone
 * header read "lazy-bac…"/"uc-smoke-2…" with an ellipsis): the OLD
 * evaluation tier was {@link ZONE_SPACING_PRACTICAL_ZOOM} (0.35). At any
 * zoom BELOW it — 26% is reachable and common after a fleet-wide fit — the
 * live lodScale factor exceeds the budgeted one by up to 0.35/0.25 = 1.4x,
 * and the name span (the row's only shrinkable flex item) absorbed the
 * entire shortfall. The previously documented "accepted residual" was
 * wrong: sizing the floor at the REACHABLE worst case costs exactly that
 * 1.4x once, statically, in pack width — versus re-paying it on screen as
 * a truncated name every session (fit lands wherever the content bounding
 * box dictates, not where our idea of "practical" is). The full-name
 * guarantee now holds at EVERY reachable zoom, by construction: below
 * LOD_FLOOR_ZOOM nothing can go (minZoom), at/above it the compensation
 * only shrinks.
 *
 * Same documented behaviour as before for names past
 * {@link ZONE_TITLE_RESERVED_NAME_CHARS}: those already truncate with a
 * MIDDLE ellipsis via `lib/truncateMiddle.ts`, so the floor sizes the
 * capped form — and any residual ellipsis is always announced
 * (`ProjectGroupNode.tsx`'s name span carries its own `overflow: hidden` +
 * `textOverflow: ellipsis`), never a silent hard clip.
 *
 * Worked example (the exact case David's own repro used):
 * "uc-smoke-2026-08-12" is 19 characters (under the 28-char cap) —
 * `(19*12.5*0.56 + 40) * lodScale(0.25, 12.5, 11.5) = (133+40) * 3.68 =
 * 173 * 3.68 ≈ 637` flow px (was ≈455 at the old 0.35 tier). A zone this
 * wide renders that name in FULL at ANY reachable zoom — the entire reason
 * for this fix.
