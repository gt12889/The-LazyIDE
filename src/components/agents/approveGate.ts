 *      evaluates; a defensive floor item in its own right, not merely an
 *      early return, since a genuine run FAILURE (status 'failed') must
 *      never reach auto-merge through this path either).
 *   2. contract.gates.humanApprove === true → never eligible, in EITHER
 *      auto mode — the mission's own explicit per-mission opt-out always
 *      wins over the project-level mode (spec: "always wins").
 *   3. Budget cap exceeded (isBudgetExceeded) → never eligible, in EITHER
 *      auto mode — "budget caps still enforced" is a hard floor, not a
 *      green-path-only rule.
 *   4. A CONCLUSIVE security-reviewer rejection (hasSecurityRejection) →
 *      never eligible, in EITHER auto mode — full_auto's "even inconclusive"
 *      permissiveness never extends to an explicit reject.
 *   5. A REAL, conclusive judge rejection (`judgeVerdict.passed === false`
 *      AND NOT scoreUnavailable — a genuine score/consensus said no, as
 *      opposed to no usable signal at all) → never eligible, in EITHER auto
 *      mode. This is the line between "inconclusive" (full_auto proceeds)
 *      and "rejected" (neither mode ever does) the design calls for.
 *   6. The GREEN path — judgeVerdict present, passed === true, and
 *      hasRequiredProofs — eligible in BOTH auto_green and full_auto,
 *      useForce: false (checkApproveGate already allows this unassisted).
 *   7. Otherwise (verdict absent, or scoreUnavailable, or proofs missing,
 *      and none of the floor rules above fired): eligible ONLY in
 *      full_auto, via the documented `force: true` bypass — auto_green
 *      requires the strict green path and stops here for a human, matching
 *      its own "failures/rejections/inconclusive still stop" contract.
 *      EXCEPTION (bug fix, see isEvaluationSettledUnavailable's own doc
 *      comment): when the verdict is entirely ABSENT, full_auto's bypass
 *      fires ONLY once runtime.ts's evaluation pipeline has itself settled
 *      on "no verdict is coming" — an absent verdict alone, with no such
 *      marker, means Step F simply hasn't reported back YET and is NOT
 *      eligible (mirrors auto_green here) — this is the one case this
 *      function distinguishes "pending" from "inconclusive" rather than
 *      collapsing them, because collapsing them defeated full_auto's own
 *      hard floor in the common native-mission timeline (Step D always
 *      precedes Step F's real verdict by a real, often long, gap).

 * intentionally — no UI toggle for it exists anywhere (NewMissionModal's own
 * doc comment says so directly). So today, every persisted `true` on a
 * 'review' mission IS the bug, with no exception to silently paper over. If
 * a future UI ever adds a real per-mission opt-out toggle, this precondition
 * breaks and this function must be revisited first (e.g. a
 * `gates.humanApproveExplicit` marker set only by that toggle) — it must not
 * keep running unconditionally past that point.

 * SAFETY — deliberately STRICTER than evaluateAutoMerge's own full_auto
 * floor: only ever proposes unblocking a mission on the STRICT green path
 * (`eligible === true && useForce === false`, i.e. rule #6 in
 * evaluateAutoMerge's own doc comment — real passed verdict, real proofs).
 * full_auto's documented "inconclusive evaluation, force-merge" floor
 * (`useForce === true`) is intentionally NEVER applied by this migration,
 * even in a full_auto project: a one-time batch retroactive pass must never
 * be the thing that force-merges a mission whose evaluation a human never
 * actually looked at. A rejected verdict, a missing verdict, missing proofs,
 * an exceeded budget, or `mode === 'manual'` all fall through to `eligible:
 * false` here (evaluateAutoMerge's own rules already cover 'manual' and the
