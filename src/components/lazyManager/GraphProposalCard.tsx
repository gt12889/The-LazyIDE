/* GraphProposalCard — rendered inside ManagerBubble when a manager message
   carries a `proposal` field. Shows the plan objective, steps, estimated
   cost/duration, and Validate/Modify/Reject buttons.

   On pending state, emits 'manager:expandOverlay' so the overlay widens to
   give room for the proposal. On accept/reject, emits 'manager:shrinkOverlay'.

   Accept calls agentsStore.executePlan(planId).
   Reject clears the proposal and allows the user to modify their request.

   2026-08 legibility rewrite (founder, verbatim: the in-chat graph "ne
   fonctionne pas du tout" on a complex plan) — six fixes, all confined to
   this file plus graphProposalGraph.ts (the graph data pipeline itself —
   compileOrchestrator.ts/graphIr.ts/irToCanvas.ts — is untouched), plus the
   `lazyManager.proposal.*` i18n keys the new strings below need (added to
   all six locales in the same change: a missing key falls back to the raw
   key string in the UI — itself a broken-looking symptom this rewrite
   exists to eliminate):
     1. Node visuals now reuse the REAL canvas's own palette (nodeChrome.tsx's
        `typeAccentColor`/`TypeGlyph`) and the real join diamond geometry
        (JoinNode.tsx's rotate(45)/0.6-scale recipe), instead of a flat
        hand-rolled amber SVG. The contest ("best-of-N") node gets a real
        double-outline + pill instead of a small "N" badge.
     2. NEVER DEGRADE IN SILENCE — the old `buildFallbackLayout` used to be
        PAINTED FIRST, then silently swapped for the real elkjs layout a
        moment later (a visible jump — the exact "double layout" bug the
        design review flagged). It is now only ever used as a real, honest
        degraded view if elkjs genuinely fails; while elkjs is resolving,
        `ProposalGraphPreview` renders a `Skeleton` placeholder instead — so
        there is exactly ONE visible transition (skeleton -> real graph),
        never two different "real-looking" graphs shown back to back. A
        bounded watchdog (`LAYOUT_RESOLUTION_TIMEOUT_MS`) hardens this:
        even a pathological elkjs stall (a never-settling promise) lands on
        the honest degraded view + banner, never a perpetual skeleton.
     3. Labels are single-line + CSS ellipsis (via a `foreignObject`, the
        standard way to get real text-overflow inside SVG) with a rich
        multi-line tooltip (role/model/dependencies) instead of the old
        `labelLines()` hard-wrap that mangled real step titles.
     4. Broken-dependency warning — partial approval (unchecking a step) can
        silently leave a still-checked step depending on an unchecked one;
        `computeDependencyWarnings` (graphProposalGraph.ts, pure) flags this
        and a banner renders right above the action buttons, visible before
        the user clicks Validate.
     5. `proposal.steps.length === 0` now renders an explicit, honest empty
        state instead of just omitting the graph/step-list block — a
        disappearing section reads as "broken", not "there is nothing here".
     6. Nodes sharing a `joinGroup` (2+, matching compileOrchestrator.ts's
        own threshold for actually synthesizing a join) get a translucent
        backing behind them, so parallel fan-out is visible at a glance.

   Deliberately OUT of scope (left as a TODO, not half-built — see
   ProposalGraphPreview's own comment): a "see full graph" escape hatch to
   the real canvas. A pending proposal has no materialized canvas nodes yet
   (materialization only happens on Validate), so there is nothing real to
   route to before that point; the real canvas's own minimap/pan/zoom
   (CanvasView.tsx) is a separate, larger task. No bespoke pan/zoom is built
   here either way (standing instruction) — the existing scroll container is
   plain native overflow, not a new zoom widget. Also standing: no semantic
   zoom / adaptive hiding by zoom level anywhere in this card.

   2026-08 off-main-thread follow-up wave (founder's #1 complaint, live-
   diagnosed via this card's OWN diagnostics: "layout timed out after
   4000ms" while the app logged `system pressure changed: Normal ->
   Elevated`) — the six fixes above were correct but incomplete: elkjs was
   never slow, it was STARVED on the main thread. layout.ts's
   `layoutPreviewGraph` now runs off-thread (see that file's header); this
   file's own share of the fix is threefold: (a) fix #2 no longer latches
   `failedGraph` permanently — the real layout SWAPS IN and the banner
   disappears the moment a delayed result actually lands (see the effect's
   `.then` handler below); (b) `LAYOUT_RESOLUTION_TIMEOUT_MS` is raised
   4000ms -> 8000ms now that it only guards a genuinely pathological/never-
   settling case, not a busy machine; (c) the honest degraded fallback
   (and its loading-skeleton foreshadow) now scale-to-fit the chat panel
   instead of forcing a huge fixed-pixel canvas that read as clipped/
   broken — this fit mechanism (originally the fallback-only `fitContainer`
   prop) was later generalized to the SUCCESSFUL graph too; see the "third
   verification pass" entry below and `GRAPH_HEIGHT_BUDGET`'s own comment
   for the current (unconditional, no `fitContainer` boolean) shape of it.

   2026-08 second verification pass — the founder's own CDP probe showed
   `layoutPreviewGraph` resolving in ~20ms for the SAME proposal a live card
   was permanently stuck on ("layout timed out after 8000ms", never
   recovering for minutes). The `.then`/`.catch` handlers below used to gate
   their ENTIRE body (including the un-latch/recovery logic) behind a
   per-effect-invocation `cancelled` boolean — correct for "should I React
   to a result for a graph that is no longer relevant", but a strictly
   PER-INVOCATION flag has a real gap: it cannot distinguish "this exact
   invocation was cleaned up because a DIFFERENT invocation for the SAME
   still-current graph is now handling it" (harmless — StrictMode's dev-only
   double effect invoke does exactly this) from "this graph is genuinely
   stale". `currentGraphRef` below replaces it with a check against the
   ACTUAL latest rendered graph (updated on every render, not tied to any
   one effect invocation): a settling promise is applied whenever its own
   `graph` is STILL the current one, regardless of which invocation started
   it — and a `console.debug` trail (previewLayoutWorkerClient.ts's own
   `debugLog`, shared `window.__lazyLayoutDebugLog` ring buffer) now marks
   every settle as "applied" or "stale (superseded)" so this is verifiable
   live, not just reasoned about — see that module's own header for the CDP
   read command.

   2026-08 third verification pass — CONFIRMED FIXED live: the watchdog fix
   above works, the graph renders. But the founder measured the SUCCESSFUL
   graph's own SVG at 916x236 inside a docked panel column ~300px wide —
   one node visible, the rest reachable only by scrolling. "A 12-node plan
   that shows one node at a time is still a failure" for a feature whose
   whole point is grasping a plan's SHAPE at a glance before approving it.
   Fix #4/#7's scale-to-fit treatment (GRAPH_HEIGHT_BUDGET/
   DOCKED_PANEL_WIDTH_FLOOR/MIN_READABLE_SCALE, all just above) was real but
   had only ever been wired to the DEGRADED fallback view
   (`fitContainer={isFailed}`) — the successful graph, the actual point of
   this feature, still rendered at a fixed large pixel size. Both paths now
   go through the identical fit logic unconditionally, responsive to this
   card's REAL measured width (a ResizeObserver, not a hardcoded pixel
   constant) so the manager overlay's expanded state genuinely gets more
   room instead of staying capped at the docked width, with a legibility
   floor (`MIN_READABLE_SCALE`) below which free-text labels are omitted in
   favor of the existing numbered badge/type glyph — full detail always one
   hover away via the unchanged `<title>` tooltip. This is a one-time,
   non-interactive density choice from (content size, real container size)
   at render time, not the canvas's own rejected "semantic zoom" (no zoom
   control exists on this card, nothing changes as anyone interacts with
   anything) — see `MIN_READABLE_SCALE`'s own comment for the full
   reasoning on why these are different mechanisms, not a case of quietly
   ignoring that standing rule.

   2026-08 fourth verification pass — the founder manually expanded the
   panel to 769px (well past the docked 244px floor the third pass fixed)
   and STILL saw every node as a bare numbered badge + glyph, no text at
   all: "there is plainly room for step titles at that width". Root cause
   (live-verified against elkjs, not assumed): `MIN_READABLE_SCALE` gated
   on the WHOLE graph's fit scale, `Math.min(width ratio, height ratio, 1)`
   — but `GRAPH_HEIGHT_BUDGET` is a fixed 216px regardless of panel width,
   so any plan with real fan-out is HEIGHT-bound, not width-bound (the
   founder's own described shape — 2 sequential -> 4-way parallel -> join
   -> 3-chain — lays out via elkjs to 1494x460, whose fit scale caps at
   216/460=0.47 no matter how wide the container gets; widening the panel
   could never cross the old 0.6 floor for this shape). `MIN_READABLE_SCALE`
   is replaced by `MIN_LEGIBLE_LABEL_BOX_PX`, gating on the label's actual
   RENDERED (post-scale) on-screen pixel width instead of the abstract
   scale fraction — see that constant's own comment just above
   `computeGraphFit` for the full formula. The other half of the same bug:
   text used to shrink 1:1 with the ambient scale (an 11px font at
   scale=0.47 rendered as an illegible 5.2px), which would have made even a
   correctly-widened box useless — every text element in `RealGraphSvg` now
   counter-scales its own font-size (`<CONST>_PX / scale`) to a constant
   on-screen size, so node geometry still shrinks with the graph but text
   never does.

   2026-08 "giant empty rectangle" fix (David, verbatim: "pourquoi la j'ai
   un agent géant dans le canva ??") — investigated fresh against this
   exact file's own git history before touching anything. The empty boxes
   are NOT a bug: dcd708a ("readable plan proposal — empty graph boxes")
   deliberately removed free-text titles from inside these nodes after
   David called the earlier labeled version illisible even WITH the
   legibility-floor machinery above (MIN_LEGIBLE_LABEL_BOX_PX/counter-scaled
   fonts) already in place — and GraphProposalCardFit.test.tsx locks that
   decision in explicitly ("boxes are never labeled at any width... by
   design"). So the fix here is deliberately NOT "add a truncated title via
   `truncateMiddle`" — that reopens a question this same user already
   answered once, in this same file, with a test suite guarding the answer.
   What WAS still a real, undecided bug: `TASK_NODE_SIZE` stayed 180x84 —
   the actual content (a 21x21 badge + a 16x16 glyph/pill) only ever
   occupied a ~30px-tall strip, so 64% of every box's height was bare
   background fill. That disproportion, not a missing label, is what reads
   as "a giant agent [box] with nothing in it". `TASK_NODE_SIZE` (see its
   own comment in graphProposalGraph.ts) is now 120x40 — sized to its real
   content, not shrunk to nothing (still room for the contest pill without
   forcing dense mode) — and every node below now vertically CENTERS its
   badge/glyph/pill in the box instead of pinning them to a fixed top-left/
   top-right offset that assumed a much taller box. The branching structure
   (joins, contest fan-out, joinGroup backing, dashed dependency edges) is
   the graph's real value over the flat ÉTAPES list underneath it and stays
   untouched — this pass only fixes the box-to-content ratio, never the
   free-text question already settled above.

// fix #4 (2026-08 legibility follow-up, founder's own photograph: "half the

// (PREVIEW_LAYERED_OPTIONS's tight spacing) is normally close to this size
// already; the honest DEGRADED fallback (buildFallbackLayout's plain BFS
// layering) is not — a 15-node plan easily lays out to 1000+px wide, and
// the old rendering forced the SVG's own pixel width/height to match that
// large content 1:1 (`Math.max(viewWidth, 420)`), which only ever GROWS the

// (functionally "clipped" to the user, whatever the DOM technically
// allowed).
//
// fix #7 (2026-08 third verification pass, founder: "the graph does not

// past a couple of nodes. Both paths now go through the SAME fit logic
// unconditionally (`RealGraphSvg` no longer takes a `fitContainer` boolean
// at all): `GRAPH_HEIGHT_BUDGET` bounds height, and width is always
// responsive (`width="100%"`) to `containerWidth` — the card's OWN real
// measured width (via `ResizeObserver` in `ProposalGraphPreview`, the same
// ad-hoc-per-component pattern already used by TerminalView.tsx/
// BrainGraph3D.tsx — no shared hook exists in this codebase yet worth
// adding for a single caller), so the graph automatically uses the extra
// room when the manager overlay is expanded (ManagerOverlay.tsx:
// EXPANDED_MIN_WIDTH_FLOOR..EXPANDED_MAX_WIDTH_CAP, 480-920px) instead of
// staying capped at the docked width. `DOCKED_PANEL_WIDTH_FLOOR` is the

// anywhere). The old `MIN_READABLE_SCALE=0.6` gated density on the WHOLE
// graph's fit scale (`Math.min(width ratio, height ratio, 1)`) — "is the
// overall zoom-out factor above X". That conflates two different
// questions: GRAPH_HEIGHT_BUDGET is a FIXED 216px regardless of how wide
// the panel gets, so a plan with any real fan-out is HEIGHT-bound, not
// width-bound — verified live via elkjs against the founder's own
// described shape (2 sequential -> 4-way parallel -> join -> 3-chain):
// that lays out to 1494x460, whose fit scale caps at 216/460=0.47 NO
// MATTER how wide the container gets. Panel-width expansion could never
// cross the old 0.6 floor for this exact shape — the founder's "there is
// plainly room at this width" was right about the WIDTH, wrong only in
// assuming width was the binding dimension.
//
// The fix asked for directly: stop asking "is the overall scale above X"
// and ask "does a legible number of characters fit inside THIS node at
// this scale" — gate on the label's actual RENDERED (post-scale) on-
// screen pixel width, not the abstract scale fraction. (At the time this
// was a task node's own foreignObject label area; the 2026-08 "giant empty
// rectangle" fix above moved `REPRESENTATIVE_LABEL_BOX_USER_PX`'s
// declaration next to `DOCKED_PANEL_WIDTH_FLOOR` and re-anchored the SAME
// mechanism to the contest pill/joinGroup caption, since task nodes carry
// no free text at all anymore — the underlying "gate on rendered pixels,
// not raw scale" fix described in this paragraph is otherwise unchanged.)

// Text must stay legible at ANY graph scale — a font size that shrinks

// half of this same bug — a wide-enough box with an unreadable font is no
// more useful than the old glyph-only view. Every text element gated by
// `dense` in `RealGraphSvg` below sets its CSS font-size to
// `<CONST>_PX / scale` (user-space units) so the ambient scale brings it
// back down to a CONSTANT on-screen size, independent of how zoomed-out
// the overall graph is — node geometry (rects/diamonds/edges) still
// scales normally, only text is counter-scaled, so "shape at a glance,
// content on demand" no longer trades one off against the other.

          they never ran, and clicking "Valider & lancer" below replays them
          (gated for real, see executePlan's own doc comment) right along
          with the plan itself. Previously this card never mentioned them at
          all — the user had no way to see, before validating, that doing so
          would also run N other actions (one of which may itself still ask
          for a separate approval). Labeled with the EXACT SAME
          describePendingAction() strings the pending-approval card and the
          message's own action chips already use, so this list, the chip
          row above the card, and any approval prompt that follows can never

              component `pending` with NO `proposal.planId` at all (generate_plan
              denied/asked-for-approval/failed-without-throwing/thrown — see
              that fix's own doc comment for the full four-path trace). The
              click handler below was ALREADY correctly guarded
              (`if (proposal.planId)`), so the button never actually launched
              anything in that state — but it still rendered fully enabled
              (`disabled: false`, clickable, no toast/error/journal entry),
              which is indistinguishable from "broken" to whoever clicks it.
              `canValidate` makes that inertness a REAL, visible disabled
              state instead of a silent no-op, and the message right below
              (`graph-proposal-no-planid`) says why — reusing whatever
              specific reason agentsStore.tsx already attached to
              `proposal.errorMessage` (rendered above via the SAME banner
              the "N action(s)... still need your approval" message already
              uses) when one was recorded, and a generic fallback for the
              one narrow case that store-side fix deliberately leaves
              unexplained (a superseded generation — never mutates a stale
              message's state, same convention as every other generation
              guard in that function) — the button's own disabled state is
              never conditional on that reason existing, only on `planId`
              itself, so it can never lie regardless. */}
