/* managerHostRegistry — the registration point that lets LazyManager have
   exactly ONE mounted instance for the app's whole session while still
   visually living inside two very different chrome pieces: the cockpit's
   floating ManagerOverlay and CodeSpace's docked right rail.

   ROOT CAUSE this exists to fix (measured live, see the PR this shipped
   with): SpacesLayer (AppShell.tsx) intentionally keeps every visited
   space mounted forever (display:none when inactive) so heavy state
   (terminal PTYs, editor tabs, ...) survives a space switch. ManagerOverlay
   (rendered inside the 'agents' space, via Cockpit.tsx) and CodeSpace (the
   'code' space) each used to instantiate their OWN
   `<LazyManagerStoreProvider><LazyManager /></LazyManagerStoreProvider>`
   directly. Once a user had visited BOTH spaces, both copies stayed
   mounted and fully live at once — one visible, one at 0x0 but still
   running every effect LazyManager owns (persistence writes, bus
   subscriptions, timers, polling), and duplicating
   `data-testid="manager-input"`/`manager-send` in the DOM (Playwright
   strict-mode violations; a driver reading the same reply twice).

   FIX: keep exactly one `<LazyManager>` React instance, mounted once by
   <ManagerHost> (managerHost.tsx) at the AppShell root — never inside a
   per-space keep-alive slot — and portal its rendered DOM into whichever
   host is the currently active space. ManagerOverlay/CodeSpace stop
   instantiating LazyManager themselves; they just register a DOM container
   (via the ref callback returned by useManagerHostSource) and their own
   live props (orchestrator vs. coder) into this registry. <ManagerHost>
   reads whichever entry matches the active space and portals into it.

   Why a portal instead of "only render LazyManager in whichever host is
   active" (i.e. two call sites, each conditionally rendering): that would
   still mount/unmount the SAME logical component across different parents
   on every space switch, resetting LazyManager's own local UI state (the
   composer draft `input`, the history-drawer open/closed flag, drag-resize
   width — see LazyManager.tsx's own useState calls) — a real regression
   given the component's stated design intent ("One panel, one header, one
   history, one composer" — LazyManager.tsx's header comment). A portal
   keeps the SAME component instance (same Fiber, same local state) and
   only moves which DOM node it paints into, so switching cockpit <-> code
   is now not just effect-safe but also state-preserving (an in-progress
   draft survives a space switch instead of being silently dropped).

   Why NOT React Context + useState for the registry itself: LazyManager
   props (`signals`, `onAnswerSignal`, ...) are cockpit-local values
   recomputed on every ManagerOverlay render. Pushing them into a React
   Context value via useState would re-render EVERY consumer (including the
   pushing component itself, since it also reads the context to get the
   register functions) on every push, and since the pushed object is a
   fresh literal every render, that would loop indefinitely. Instead this
   registry is a plain external store (no React state) that only notifies
   its own subscribers (useSyncExternalStore, used solely by <ManagerHost>)
   — pushing into it never re-renders the pushing component. */
