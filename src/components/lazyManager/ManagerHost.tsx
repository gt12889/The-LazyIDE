/* ManagerHost — the ONE place LazyManager is ever mounted. See
   managerHostRegistry.tsx's header comment for the full root-cause writeup
   and the reasoning behind portalling instead of duplicating instances or
   conditionally mounting per space.

   Mounted exactly once, at the AppShell root (a sibling of SpacesLayer, not
   inside any per-space keep-alive slot — see AppShell.tsx), for the app's
   entire session. Owns the single LazyManagerStoreProvider + LazyManager
   pair and portals LazyManager's rendered DOM into whichever registered
   host (cockpit's ManagerOverlay or CodeSpace's docked rail) is currently
   the active space.

   IMPORTANT: `createPortal`'s own `container` argument is a STABLE node
   (`portalNode` below), created once and NEVER swapped across renders —
   confirmed empirically (a failing round-trip test) that React does NOT
   reliably preserve the portalled subtree's component state when a portal's
   `container` argument changes identity between renders; whether that
   counts as a remount internally or not, LazyManager's own local state
   (composer draft, ...) was observed reset. Swapping which HOST a fixed
   portal node lives inside is instead done with a plain, React-independent
   `container.appendChild(portalNode)` in a layout effect — moving an
   already-attached DOM node via `appendChild` only relocates it (the
   browser does not destroy/recreate its subtree), and since `createPortal`
   is always called with the SAME `portalNode` reference, React never sees
   a container change at all and has no reason to touch the subtree. */
