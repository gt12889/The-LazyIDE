/* paths.ts — Shared, pure path helpers for Windows "\\?\" (verbatim /
   extended-length) path handling.

   BACKGROUND: this exact bug class has already been fixed three times in
   this codebase, each time re-deriving the same logic ad hoc:
     1. cli/lib/git.ts's worktree-add used a RELATIVE destination path for
        `git worktree add` instead of an absolute one.
     2. managedAgent.ts's read_file/grep_file/edit_file tool calls needed
        stripVerbatimPrefix() because the `read_file` Tauri command rejects
        the \\?\ prefix (while `write_file` accepts it).
     3. evaluator.ts's resolveWorktreePath() had to join repoPath with a
        separator-aware join instead of a hardcoded '/': repoPath is
        typically get_project_root's Rust std::fs::canonicalize() result,
        which on Windows is \\?\-prefixed (verbatim). Verbatim paths disable
        Win32's '/'-to-'\' separator normalization, so appending
        "/foo/bar" with a literal '/' produces a mixed-separator string
        (e.g. `\\?\C:\...\lazygt/foo/bar`) that Rust's Path::canonicalize()
        fails to resolve even though the directory exists on disk.

   This module centralizes the small pure primitives behind those fixes so a
   4th instance (agentsStore.tsx's discardMission — see its
   resolveDiscardWorktreePath) — and any future one — reuses a tested helper
   instead of re-deriving the same regex/logic ad hoc.

   5th instance (QA B11, 2026-07): runtime.ts's mergeWorktree passed
   `repoPath` straight through to the `agent_merge_worktree` Tauri invoke
   with no normalization at all. resolveProjectRoot (agentsStore.tsx) has
   THREE possible sources for a project root — `get_project_root` (Rust
   canonicalize, always \\?\-prefixed backslash-only on Windows),
   `find_git_root` (git-style forward-slash, never \\?\-prefixed), and
   `get_cwd` — and callers occasionally see a value built by joining one of
   those with ANOTHER separator style upstream. A \\?\-prefixed path with
   even one stray "/" in it disables Win32's separator translation for the
   WHOLE string, so `git merge`'s `Command::current_dir` on the Rust side
   fails with the Windows-specific "os error 267" (ERROR_DIRECTORY) even
   though the directory genuinely exists — a legit, judge-approved mission
   (M11) failed to merge this way while another (M9) merged fine moments
   earlier from the same UI action. Fixed by normalizing ONCE at the
   mergeWorktree boundary (see runtime.ts) via normalizeRepoPathForGit
   below, instead of trusting every caller to have produced a clean path.
   HONESTY NOTE (2026-08-05): the original QA B11 fix only normalized
   `repoPath` — `mergeWorktree`'s `mergeIntoDir` param (the orchestrator
   fan-in merge path) stayed raw and could still hit this exact bug; now
   normalized too, and every worktree invoke in runtime.ts (createWorktree,
   worktreeDiff, discardWorktree) got the same treatment, not just merge.

   CONSOLIDATED: instances 2 and 3 above (managedAgent.ts's
   stripVerbatimPrefix, evaluator.ts's resolveWorktreePath) and
   agentsStore.tsx's resolveDiscardWorktreePath now all import stripVerbatimPrefix
   / joinPath from here instead of keeping local copies. managedAgent.ts
   re-exports stripVerbatimPrefix under its own name (managedAgent.test.ts
   imports it from there) rather than duplicating the implementation.

   6th (missionScopeGuard.ts, 2026-08-01) and 7th (projectForPath.ts /
   CodeSpace.tsx, 2026-08-02) instances are documented on
   normalizeForPathCompare's own doc comment below.

   8th instance (2026-08-15): BreadcrumbBar.tsx split a raw editor tab path
   on separators without stripping the verbatim prefix first, rendering a
   literal "?" as the breadcrumb's leading crumb. Fixed by reusing
   basename/stripVerbatimPrefix here plus a new relativeToRoot helper
   (fileTree.ts) — see that commit for the fix, and BreadcrumbBar.tsx's
   breadcrumbSegments for the current call site.

   9th instance (2026-08-15, structural-hardening pass): unlike instances
   1-8, this one was never a path VALUE reaching UI/comparison code raw —
   it was a raw path embedded mid-sentence inside a Rust command's FREE-
   TEXT error message (`nativeHealth()`'s `details.git`/`details.brain` in
   tauri.ts did `String(err)` straight from a rejected invoke(), and the
   path-jail guard's rejection text names the offending path in full), so
   the Settings Health panel rendered a literal
   `\\?\C:\Users\user\Documents\cerveau` in its technical-detail text.
   None of the whole-string helpers above apply to a value that merely
   CONTAINS a path — added stripVerbatimPrefixesInText below (scans the
   whole string for the prefix instead of only checking index 0) and wired
   it into both nativeHealth() catch handlers.

   STRUCTURAL GUARD (2026-08-15): eight-plus recurrences of the same
   mistake is a process failure, not eight unlucky ones — added a local
   ESLint rule (eslint-rules/no-raw-path-ops.js, wired up in
   eslint.config.js as local/no-raw-path-ops) that flags manual
   backslash-separator splitting/replacing and raw .startsWith()
   containment checks on path-like-named values, pointing the author back
   to this file. See that rule file's own header for why a raw `===`
   equality check was evaluated and deliberately NOT included (too noisy
   against this codebase's real usage), and why a branded NormalizedPath
   type and a single Rust->TS IPC choke point were considered and rejected
   in favor of the lint rule (no single invoke() wrapper exists in this
   codebase — invoke() is called directly ~145 times across 73 files, so
   there is no one boundary to normalize at).
