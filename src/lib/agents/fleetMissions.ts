/* fleetMissions.ts — cross-project mission read-model (D3).

   Polls `journal_missions_current` (Tauri invoke, NO project filter — same
   call/precedent as SpacesRail's useRunningMissionCounts) every ~2.5s and
   groups the resulting rows by project, deriving a coarse pipeline stage
   per mission (see fleetStage.ts) for the Cockpit/Code redesign's
   per-project grid.

   For the currently ACTIVE project, live agentsStore missions (streaming,
   no polling lag) are merged over the journal snapshot when an
   AgentsStoreProvider ancestor exists (i.e. AgentsSpace has been visited
   this session) — see useAgentsStoreOptional's doc comment on that
   optional-outside-the-provider contract. This is a
   best-effort merge: agentsStore's own mission list does not carry a
   project id and is not re-loaded when the active project changes after
   AgentsSpace first mounts (a pre-existing gap, not fixed here — see
   code-shell-map.md §10), so the merge can show stale missions for a
   moment right after switching projects. The journal snapshot for that
   project is still polled underneath and takes back over once agentsStore
   itself catches up.

   Web (non-Tauri): always returns an empty project list — no mock data
   (repo convention: real data or an honest empty state).

 * Merge the active project's live (streaming) agentsStore missions OVER its

 * testing (see src/__tests__/fleetMissions.test.ts).
 *
 * Fixes two real regressions found in the live app (post-e2e fix wave):
 *
 *  - F11 (mission vanishes from the grid): the active project's branch used
 *    to REPLACE journalMissions outright with `liveStore.missions.map(...)`
 *    instead of merging. A mission that transitions out of agentsStore's own
 *    live tracking (e.g. running -> review, where the store stops actively
 *    streaming it) but is still present in the journal — the actual source
 *    of truth — vanished from the grid entirely, along with its urgent
 *    review card and its contribution to the agents KPI. This walks the
 *    journal list first (so every journal-known mission always keeps a slot)
 *    and only overlays a live mission's fresher fields on top by id.
 *
 *  - F4 (misattribution): agentsStore's own mission list carries no project
 *    id (see module doc comment above) — so a live mission that actually
 *    belongs to ANOTHER project (per `missionOwner`, built from the
 *    journal's own per-row project_id, the real source of truth for
 *    ownership) must never be duplicated into the active project's group.
 *    Only a mission with NO journal row anywhere (`missionOwner` has no
 *    entry for it — e.g. a [DEMO] dev-seed mission) is treated as
 *    legitimately local to the active project, since it exists nowhere else
 *    to attribute it to.
 *
 * Dedupe/merge is always keyed by mission id, NEVER by title — two distinct
 * missions can legitimately share the exact same title (see the M8/M9 case
 * this fixes: both titled "QA pricing — tests unitaires").
