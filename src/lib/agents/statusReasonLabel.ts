/* statusReasonLabel.ts — translates Mission.statusReason for display.

   Bug (real, confirmed live in the packaged app): mission card M26 rendered
   the literal machine token "consecutive_failures" instead of prose — the
   sibling card, for the same field, correctly showed "Mission interrompue
   au redémarrage" (agentsStore.tsx already calls t('agents.recoveredOnRestart')
   at the WRITE site for that one path). The write sites are inconsistent:
   some translate before ever setting Mission.statusReason (recoveredOnRestart,
   budgetExceededReason/durationExceededReason in runtime.ts, the silence
   watchdog's stopReason), others store the raw machine reason verbatim —
   runtime.ts's managed-loop failure branches (`managedOutcome.failed.reason`,
   `stepCapFallthroughReason`, both sourced from managedAgent.ts's emitMetrics
   calls), globalRuntime.ts's crash-recovery sweep ('interrupted_by_crash'),
   and agentsStore.tsx's launch-stall watchdog ('launch_stalled').

   Rather than translate at every one of those write sites (easy to miss the
   NEXT one that gets added), every render site funnels statusReason through
   this ONE function first — see missionCardReason.test.tsx-style call sites
   in MissionCard.tsx, MissionNode.tsx, ManagerSignalBubble.tsx and
   ContextualBanner.tsx. KNOWN_REASONS is the full enumerated list of every
   raw token found in the codebase (grepped every `statusReason:` assignment
   site — see this module's own test file for the sweep that keeps this
   list honest). Anything already-human (a translated sentence built at the
   write site, or free-form error text like "worktree_creation_failed: <err>"
   or a captured exception message) passes through unchanged; a genuinely
   unknown bare machine token — one this module has never seen, e.g. a
   future reason added to managedAgent.ts without updating KNOWN_REASONS —
   NEVER reaches the UI verbatim: it falls back to a generic, honest,
   translated sentence instead.

   `t` is optional (mirrors runtime.ts's TFunc convention throughout this
   codebase) — omitting it falls back to the original hardcoded French,
   never a behavior change for existing callers that predate i18n. */
