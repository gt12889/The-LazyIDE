// (`ALL_MODELS.some(...)`, `catalog.some(...)`) rejected every one of these
// outright via UnknownManagerModelIdError, and because modelId is checked
// BEFORE the tier-hint fallback, there was no recovery: the action just
// failed. Since the SAME default-model resolution path is shared by actions
// that never even named a specific model, one malformed default was enough
// to take down unrelated launches too — for one night, NO mission launch
// got through. Fixed with a strictly-scoped tolerant lookup: an id is only
// ever silently accepted when it is TRIVIALLY safe to do so (same rail, same
// model, cosmetic prefix only) — anything more speculative (a different
// vendor claimed, or the model living on an entirely different rail) is
// still a hard rejection, just a more actionable one.

// is "pro" (that id lives on the DeepSeek BYOK catalog, not OpenRouter's),
// "claude-sonnet-5" while engine is a non-Anthropic BYOK provider, and so

// exists on a DIFFERENT rail than the one requested this turn. When that
// other rail is the user's ONLY plausible other home for the id (exactly
// one match, not two or more), rejecting is strictly worse than just
// running it there: the fix below silently switches the EFFECTIVE rail
// instead. This is safe specifically because dispatch never re-reads
// resolveManagerModelId's `mode`/`engineOverride` inputs afterwards — the
// mission is routed downstream purely from the RETURNED id's own shape
// (classifyMissionModel, runtime.ts: a '/' means managed/pro, a bare id on a
// configured non-Anthropic BYOK catalog means byok, everything else means
// native) — so returning the OTHER rail's id here is already the complete
// switch; there is no separate "engine" flag anywhere downstream left
// pointing at the old, wrong rail. Ambiguity (2+ rails carry the id) or a
// genuinely unknown id (0 rails) both keep today's honest rejection, now

 *   keeps today's mode-based behavior, including the BUG-2 rescue.
 * @param modelId Exact catalog id (ManagerModelId, types.ts) — checked
 *   BEFORE `tier` and validated against the CURRENT effective rail's real
 *   catalog (ALL_MODELS on the native/CLI rail, OPENROUTER_MODELS on the
 *   managed/Pro rail). Throws UnknownManagerModelIdError, never silently
 *   substitutes a DEFAULT, when the id does not belong to that rail's
 *   family — the two id spaces stay deliberately incompatible in what gets
 *   STORED/dispatched (see openrouterCatalog.ts's module comment). Tolerant
 *   normalization wave (2026-08-05): a COSMETIC mismatch — an OpenRouter-
 *   style "vendor/rest" id whose "rest" is a real id on THIS rail, vendor
 *   agreeing — is silently rewritten to the rail's own bare id instead of
 *   rejected (see resolveBareRailModelId); a genuine cross-rail id, or a
 *   disagreeing vendor prefix, is still an honest rejection, just enriched
 *   with a hint when one is available (findOpenRouterAliasHint /
 *   findByokHomeHint). Inferred-rail-switch wave (2026-08-05 night 2): when
 *   the id is not on the requested rail at all (even after the cosmetic
 *   normalization above) but is real on EXACTLY ONE other rail the user can
 *   plausibly run on right now (a configured BYOK provider, the CLI rail, or
 *   the Pro rail), the EFFECTIVE rail is silently switched to that one
 *   instead of rejecting — see tryInferredRailSwitch/findAlternateRailMatches
 *   above. Two or more candidate rails, or none at all, still fall through
 *   to the honest rejection. Absent (the default) keeps today's tier-only
 *   behavior unchanged.
