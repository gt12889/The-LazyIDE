/* projectCommandTools.ts — W-BYO row 2 (canvas scorecard §4.5 "BYO agents",
   the deeper "custom tool" half of the one genuinely-open row).

   Scope, stated up front (per this wave's own instruction — "scope
   honestly, don't fake a sandbox"): this is NOT a general user-defined-tool
   system. A "commande de projet" tool is a NAMED, DESCRIBED binding onto a
   command that must already pass `isWorktreeScriptCommand`
   (worktreeScriptCommands.ts) — the exact same narrow allowlist
   (`npm run <script>` / `npm test|ci|install` / `npx tsc|vite build|vitest`
   / `cargo check|build|test`, no chaining/piping/redirection/substitution)
   the R6b scoped-worktree-script gate already enforces server-side
   (shell.rs's `matches_worktree_script_allowlist`) for acceptEdits/full
   missions. Saving a tool whose command does NOT match that allowlist is
   REJECTED outright (`validateProjectCommandTool`) — there is no path in
   this module to author a tool that runs arbitrary shell text.

   This is deliberately a NAMING/CATALOG/DISCOVERY layer, not a new
   execution primitive: attaching a tool to an agent
   (`LazyAgent.projectCommandTools`, agentDef.ts) never grants new
   capability — an acceptEdits/full agent can ALREADY run any
   `isWorktreeScriptCommand`-matching command via the pre-existing R6b
   bypass in `managedToolPermissions.checkToolExecution`, with or without
   this catalog. What this catalog adds is real BYO value anyway: a
   user-authored, friendly name + description for a specific project
   command (e.g. "Lancer les tests d'intégration" -> `npm run test:integration`)
   that shows up as a discoverable, first-class capability in the agent
   wizard and in the compiled agent definition (compile.ts's
   `buildClaudeCodeAgentMd`) — the n8n-custom-node / AutoGen-tool authoring
   UX, safely bounded by an execution gate that already existed.

   Explicitly OUT of scope, and left as a design note rather than a fake
   implementation: a tool that runs an ARBITRARY user-authored shell string
   (not from the R6b allowlist) would need a real sandboxing story (a
   container, a restricted shell, a resource/time-boxed subprocess with no
   filesystem access outside a scratch dir) before it could be exposed to
   an autonomous, unattended agent — that is a product/security decision,
   not an engineering afternoon, and is NOT implemented here.

   Persistence mirrors approvalMode.ts's own documented pattern exactly
   (same module, same comment reproduced here for anyone reading only one
   of the two files): the only generic file-IO Tauri commands available are
   sandboxed to whichever project is currently OPEN
   (`ensure_write_path_in_any_open_project`, fs.rs) — there is no dedicated
   Rust command for this catalog, so it is stored as ONE JSON file under
   the ACTIVE project's `.lazy/projectCommandTools.json`, exactly like
   `approvalModes.json`. Web (non-Tauri): falls back to an in-memory mock
   array, mirroring agentsStorage.ts's `_mockStore` convention.
