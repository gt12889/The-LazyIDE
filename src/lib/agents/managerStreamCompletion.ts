// ── Streaming chunk accumulation (2026-08-12 QA: spliced/duplicated text) ──
//
// BUG (real user repro, verbatim, Claude Sonnet 5 subscription route):
//   "Je lance un agent haiku pour ajouter la fonction sum(a, b) dans
//   index.js avec l'affichage de sum(2,3) au démarrage.js(projet actif
//   uc-smoke-2026-08-12) et affichersum(2,3)` au lancement."
//
// INVESTIGATED (2026-08-12, coordinator-directed re-review — first pass
// shipped a >=8-char "drop an exact adjacent duplicate chunk" guard, which
// was WRONG and has been reverted): that heuristic is destructive (real
// streamed code routinely repeats an identical adjacent chunk — 8 spaces of
// indentation twice, a blank "\n\n" pair, a repeated identifier at a token
// boundary — and would silently delete it, invisibly, in an IDE where
// correctness of generated code matters far more than a rare display glitch)
// AND it does not even match the actual observed corruption: the two halves
// of the real repro are NOT byte-identical to each other (compare "...dans
// index.js avec l'affichage de sum(2,3) au démarrage." against "...index.js
// (projet actif uc-smoke-2026-08-12) et afficher `sum(2,3)` au lancement.")
// — a byte-equality guard would never have fired on the real chunk sequence
// either way.
//
// Three specific hypotheses were checked against the actual owned code:
//   (a) two accumulators/concurrent streams writing into the same message —
//       RULED OUT at this layer: `acc` below is a plain local variable, one
//       per streamManagerCompletion() call, never shared/module-level state.
//       runGroundedFollowUp (agentsStore.tsx) always REPLACES currentTurn
//       sequentially (`currentTurn = nextTurn`, awaited) — it never
//       concatenates two turns' raw text together; every grounded return
//       reads turnDisplayText(currentTurn) from the SINGLE latest turn.
//       Nothing in sendManagerMessage starts a second call for the SAME
//       conversation while a first is still in flight for this repro (no
//       grounding action was involved, so runGroundedFollowUp short-circuits
//       via `findGroundingActions` returning empty). A UI-level double-send
//       race (e.g. a doubled click before the composer disables) was not
//       fully ruled out — it lives in agentsStore.tsx/LazyManagerComposer.tsx,
//       outside this fix's owned files.
//   (b) a prompt-side template splicing project-context annotation into the
//       model's own text — RULED OUT in the TS layer: no "projet actif" /
//       "active project" template string exists anywhere that writes into
//       the SAME variable the transport's chunks land in. The system prompt
//       (buildManagerDynamicContext) and the `acc`/rawResponse accumulator
//       below are structurally separate strings in every one of the four
//       streamManagerCompletion branches — the system prompt is sent AS
//       INPUT to the model, never appended to its OUTPUT after the fact.
//   (c) a retry/reconnect starting a second stream without discarding the
//       first — NO retry exists at the JS layer (streamClaudeCodeTurn /
//       cliBackendProvider / the BYOK raw streamers / streamManagedAgentTurn
//       each issue exactly ONE request per streamManagerCompletion call, no
//       automatic reconnect). Reading src-tauri/src/commands/chat.rs
//       (read-only — out of this fix's editable scope) surfaces a credible
//       mechanism, though NOT provable from a JS unit test: `claude -p
//       --output-format stream-json --verbose` is itself a multi-step
//       internal agent loop that can emit SEVERAL separate "assistant"-typed
//       stream-json lines for one logical LazyManager turn — Rust relays
//       every one of them as an independent model://chunk event with no
//       boundary/reset marker between them (extract_text_from_stream_json,
//       chat.rs:662). A closely related leak from that exact same multi-step
//       behavior (the CLI harness's own synthetic re-prompt text) was
//       already found and fixed there — see that function's own doc comment,
//       chat.rs:647-661. If the external `claude` binary internally
//       self-corrects or retries part of a response, Rust has no way to tell
//       that apart from ordinary multi-part narration (narrate -> tool call
//       -> narrate again), and would relay BOTH renderings, which this file
//       then concatenates in order — a much better structural match for the
//       real repro (two overlapping, non-identical renderings glued
//       together) than a literal duplicate chunk. This is the most likely
//       root cause, but it lives inside src-tauri/chat.rs and, ultimately,
//       the external `claude` CLI's own behavior — both outside this task's
//       editable perimeter (explicitly "Do NOT touch: ... src-tauri/") and
//       not reproducible from a Vitest unit test, which cannot invoke the
//       real external CLI's stream-json output deterministically.
//
// Since no fix at THIS layer can be proven against a real reproduction, the
// coordinator's own fallback applies: never silently drop model output.
// appendManagerChunk below is back to plain, lossless concatenation — the
// final text is ALWAYS the exact, in-order join of every chunk the
// transport ever handed us, full stop. Two NON-DESTRUCTIVE diagnostics are
// added instead, so a future occurrence leaves a trail instead of a silent
// display bug: warnIfDuplicateAdjacentChunk (flags but never drops an exact,
// non-trivial-length repeat — the (mechanism the first, reverted attempt
// guessed at) and warnIfImbalancedCodeSpans (flags an odd backtick count in
// the FINAL text — a cheap, precise signal that would have fired on the real
// repro's own stray unmatched closing backtick). Both only ever log; neither
// ever changes what the user sees.
