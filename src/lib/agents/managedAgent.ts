/* managedAgent — Forge autonomous agent loop (local-first, no hosted backend).

   ReAct loop (inspired by Claude Code's agentic loop): compose task + brain
   context, stream a turn through the caller-supplied streamTurn (a CLI tool
   or the local Ollama engine — see localProvider.ts's
   createLocalAgentTurnStreamer and cliAgentTurnStreamer.ts), parse
   THOUGHT/ACTION/ARGS, execute the named tool (read_file/write_file/
   edit_file, read_dir, glob, grep_file, run_command, run_tests,
   brain_query, brain_record), feed the observation back and repeat. Stops on
   ACTION: FINAL, MAX_STEPS, or MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES consecutive errored
   steps (escalation — V4).
   execute the named tool (read_file/write_file/edit_file, read_dir, glob,
   grep_file, run_command, run_tests, brain_query, brain_record), feed the
   observation back and repeat. Stops on ACTION: FINAL, MAX_STEPS, or
   MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES consecutive errored steps (escalation — V4).

   SoA enhancements: R1 windowed read_file/grep_file; R6 Reflexion buffer
   (Shinn 2023); R7 context handoff at ~96K tokens; R8 PRM step verifier
   (SWE-PRM); R11 tool policy in the system prompt; V4 consecutive-failure
   escalation (counter resets on success; hitting the cap stops the mission
   with a clear escalation observation instead of burning the rest of
   MAX_STEPS); V5 identical-call dedup — repeating an IDENTICAL read-only
   tool call (same tool + same args) is not re-executed a 2nd time; the
   model gets a nudge observation instead, so a stuck loop (e.g. re-reading
   the same file every turn) burns one wasted step instead of MAX_STEPS.
   Mirrors assistantToolLoop.ts's searchedQueries dedup for the assistant
   chat surface. See ./managedAgentDedup.ts for which tools qualify.
   V7 (2026-08-14, M6 incident) — a parse failure is the one failure mode
   that costs 2 full model calls per attempt (original turn + the in-step
   "please re-emit" format retry), so it fast-tracks straight to the
   MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES cap the moment the SAME unparseable shape
   repeats, instead of always burning the full 3-attempt/6-call budget; see
   parseReActAction's own doc comments for the parser-side half of this fix
   (sanitizeJsonStringControlChars + the ARGS-anchored balanced-brace
   rescan), which eliminates the actual root cause for the common case
   (unescaped newlines in a multi-line write_file/edit_file `content`).

   Pro/managed parity with the native (claude-code/codex) loop: per-agent
   persona, permission/tool policy (checkToolPolicy — 'plan' is read-only,
   deniedTools/allowedTools mirror --disallowedTools/--allowedTools — plus
   toolPermissions.ts's allow/ask/exclude rules layered on top via
   checkToolExecution), and onMetrics in the native loop's AgentMetrics
   shape. Persona + tool-policy composition lives in ./managedAgentPolicy.ts
   and ./managedToolPermissions.ts (imported here, file-size cohesion).

   Model routing: this loop is invoked ONLY once runtime.ts's planAndAct has
   already resolved the mission's chosen model to a local engine (see
   planAndAct's routing-by-model dispatch) and built the matching streamTurn
   — every turn here (streamAgentTurn) therefore ALWAYS stays on that
   streamer. It must never re-derive routing from getProviderMode() and
   divert mid-loop.

   Pause / Intervene (real here, polled once per step alongside stopSignal):
   pauseSignal() true -> wait (PAUSE_POLL_MS poll, stopSignal still honored),
   no new step/model call until resumed or stopped. drainIntervenes() pops
   queued user text (agentsStore.interveneMission) and injects it as real
   user message(s) before the next turn. Both default to a no-op, like
   permissionMode/allowedTools/deniedTools on this opts type.

   Real vs estimated metrics (billing trust): onMetrics used to always report
   ceil(chars/4) estimates because the ai-proxy stream carried no usage
   metadata. It now appends a final real-usage marker after settlement (see
   managedProvider.ts's streamManagedAgentTurn/onUsage and ai-proxy's
   settleAndRecord); addTurnTokens prefers that real usage per-turn and falls
   back to the estimate only when absent (older ai-proxy deployment, or the
   claude-code/native backend below which never reports it). AgentMetrics.
   tokensSource reflects which one was actually used across the whole
   mission: 'real' (every accounted turn had it), 'estimated' (none did —
   the pre-existing behavior), or 'mixed'.

   Journal instrumentation (T0.4, spec §4.2): this loop emits mission.step
   (per iteration, plus dedicated marker:'reflexion'/marker:'prm' entries),
   tool.called (name/files/durationMs, real executions only — a deduped V5
   nudge is not a call), spend.tokens (source 'real'/'estimated' per
   addTurnTokens's existing preference), agent.handoff at the R7 context
   handoff, and mission.completed/failed alongside the existing emitMetrics
   call sites (FINAL, V4 escalation, MAX_STEPS exhaustion). All emitted via
   emitBuffered (never throws, never blocks the loop — see journal.ts).
   projectId is derived inline from worktreePath (deriveProjectId below) as
   a placeholder for the real ProjectRegistry id (T0.7) — a later
   integration pass unifies this with the rest of the journal emitters.
