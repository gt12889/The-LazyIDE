   * "vide complètement le canvas" / "nettoie les missions finies du projet

   *   - 'all': every draft/note/surface/router/join/frame across every
   *     project + Transverse, PLUS every terminal mission this store
   *     currently tracks (state.missions only ever holds the ACTIVE
   *     project's missions — see agentsStore.tsx's changeApprovalMode doc
   *     comment for this pre-existing architectural constraint).
   *   - 'project': same as 'all', narrowed to one project's zone
   *     (`projectId`, resolved by name-or-id the same way create_draft's own
   *     `projectId` is).
   *   - 'terminated' / 'failed': missions only (done/failed/cancelled, or
   *     just failed), optionally narrowed by `projectId`/`olderThanHours`.
   *     NEVER a mission in 'review' — see `includeReview` below, this is
   *     the exact gap a real user hit (P0 fix): a mission in 'review' is
   *     awaiting a human merge decision (approve/reject), not "finished" in
   *     any sense these two scopes mean, so it is deliberately left alone
   *     and the executor's own result honestly reports how many were left
   *     behind (see agentsStore.tsx's `reviewMissionsAwaitingDecision`)
   *     instead of silently reporting "nothing to clean up" in front of a
   *     canvas the user can see is still full.
   *   - 'drafts' / 'notes' / 'surfaces': that ONE canvas artifact kind only,
   *     optionally narrowed by `projectId`.
   *   - 'selection': exactly the refs named in `refs` (same explicit-list
   *     convention as save_macro's own `refs`) — the manager has no view
   *     into a live on-screen multi-select, so this targets whatever refs
   *     the user named or a prior digest showed, never a UI selection.
   * `mode` ('archive' | 'delete', default 'archive') only matters for
   * missions. `mode: 'delete'` on a mission is IRREVERSIBLE (journal history
   * is gone) — never emit it without the user explicitly asking for
   * permanent/definitive deletion (see the Rules section, managerEngine.ts).
   * `olderThanHours` narrows the MISSION side of a scope only
   * (Mission.createdAt) — a draft/note/router/join/surface/frame carries no
   * creation timestamp in this codebase, so it is honestly ignored (never
   * faked) for scopes that only touch those. No functional cap: every
   * matching item is cleared in this one action.
   *
   * `includeReview` (P0 fix — real user test: the manager promised to
   * archive review-status missions under 'terminated', the executor
   * silently excluded them, the user was left with "rien à nettoyer" in
   * front of 27 still-visible missions): an explicit, OFF-by-default opt-in
   * that widens 'all' / 'project' / 'terminated' to ALSO sweep every
   * 'review' mission into the SAME `mode` treatment as any other matched
   * mission — never for 'failed' (a distinct, single-status scope) or the
   * kind-only/'selection' scopes, where it is simply ignored. This is NOT a
   * merge decision: archiving (or deleting) a 'review' mission does not
   * approve or reject it — the pending human decision is just abandoned,
   * unresolved, and the mission disappears from the board either way. For
   * exactly that reason `includeReview: true` is ALWAYS classified
   * 'destructive' (see actionClassifier.ts's `classifyAction`), regardless
   * of `mode` — it requires approval even in full-auto, and the manager
   * MUST state, before emitting it, the exact count of review missions
   * about to lose their pending decision this way (never a vague "je
   * nettoie tout"). Prefer resolving them with approve_mission/reject_mission
   * (individually) or leaving them for the user's own review pass — reach
   * for `includeReview` only when the user explicitly accepts discarding
   * that pending decision (e.g. "archive aussi celles en revue, tant pis

 *                    rejection, and every contract.proofs kind satisfied
