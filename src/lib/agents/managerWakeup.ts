/* managerWakeup.ts — LazyManager proactive event wakeup.

   FOUNDER DIRECTIVE (verbatim): "...le réveil sur événement doit permettre
   au LazyManager d'être proactif si besoin et de réagir ou demander au
   user." Recon's #1 orchestrator gap: sendManagerMessage (agentsStore.tsx)
   only ever runs from an explicit user click — no automated call site
   exists anywhere in the codebase, so the manager's own "je vérifie à la
   prochaine occasion" promises are structurally dead: nobody ever asks it
   the next question. This module gives it a spontaneous turn instead, the
   moment something SIGNIFICANT happens to the active project while the
   user isn't talking to it.

   ARCHITECTURE
   - Polls the SAME journal-query primitive the activity ticker uses
     (queryJournalSince → journal_since — see projections.ts and
     FluxFooter.tsx's own POLL_MS-based queryActivityFeed poll) rather than
     subscribing to a live push bus: the Rust journal has no event-push
     mechanism of its own (see journal.ts's module header — it is a pure
     invoke/query store), so "subscribe to journal events" here means "poll
     for new rows since the last seen tsMs", exactly FluxFooter's own
     established pattern, just coarser (WAKEUP_POLL_MS) since a wakeup can
     end in a real LLM call, not a cheap read.
   - classifyWakeupEvent is pure and locale-agnostic (kind + raw fields
     only, e.g. missionId/reason/targetRef/hygieneTotal) — it deliberately
     does NOT build the user-facing message text, so this module stays
     completely free of any i18n dependency; agentsStore.tsx (which already
     holds a live `t()` from useI18n) formats the localized instruction
     text from the candidate list right before calling sendManagerMessage.
   - The stateful scheduler (startManagerWakeupScheduler) wraps that pure
     core with a real poll interval + a real debounce timer, entirely
     dependency-injected (fetchEventsSince/isManagerBusy/sendWakeupTurn/
     getConfig/now) so agentsStore.tsx only wires it up: start once on
     mount, stop on unmount, call notifyManagerTurnEnded on every
     managerBusy true→false transition. See that file's own wiring comment
     for the full contract.

   GUARDRAILS (founder cares about token budget — an idle fleet must never
   quietly turn into a background LLM bill):
   - DEBOUNCE_MS (90s default): a burst of terminal events (several
     missions landing within seconds of each other) coalesces into exactly
     ONE wakeup turn describing all of them, never one turn per event —
     every new significant event resets the timer (standard trailing
     debounce), so a truly noisy stretch keeps deferring until it goes
     quiet for a full debounce window.
   - MAX_AUTO_TURNS_PER_HOUR (6 default, configurable): a sliding-window
     cap — once hit, further significant events in that window are
     silently DROPPED (never queued for "later", which would just turn into
     a burst the moment the window rolls) rather than firing more turns;
     the window slides forward continuously, so a quiet stretch always
     recovers capacity on its own.
   - ECHO_SUPPRESS_MS (30s default): a manager turn's OWN actions (e.g. it
     just approved a mission as one of its own tool calls, mid-turn) emit
     journal events exactly like a human or an agent would — without this
     window, that self-caused event would arm ANOTHER wakeup the moment the
     debounce elapses: a genuine infinite-loop risk, not a hypothetical
     one. notifyManagerTurnEnded() — called by the wiring for EVERY
     managerBusy true→false transition, whether that turn was wakeup-
     triggered or an ordinary user-initiated chat turn, since either kind
     can perform a mission-mutating action — anchors this window: any
     candidate event whose OWN tsMs falls inside
     [lastManagerTurnEndedAtMs, lastManagerTurnEndedAtMs + echoSuppressMs]
     is treated as an echo and never arms or extends the debounce timer.
   - "never wake while a manager turn is already running" — isManagerBusy()
     is checked again at FIRE time (not only when the candidate event was
     first observed — the whole point of debouncing is that real time
     passes), and a busy fire is deferred with a few bounded short retries
     (see MAX_BUSY_RETRIES) rather than silently dropped, since "a user's
     own turn is still finishing" is exactly the ordinary case this rule
     exists for, not a signal to discard.
   - Full on/off toggle (isManagerWakeupEnabled/setManagerWakeupEnabled,
     localStorage-backed — same convention as fleetHygiene.ts's
     getFleetHygieneConfig/getConfiguredGracePeriodMs) — re-read at every
     decision point (both when a candidate event arrives and again at fire
     time), so flipping it off mid-debounce cancels the pending batch
     cleanly instead of firing one last time.
