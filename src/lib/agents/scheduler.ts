/* scheduler.ts — provider-aware concurrency scheduler for agent missions
   (T1.1, spec §7.1).

   Every mission launch routes through ONE "pool" keyed by the engine that
   will run it (resolveProvider): the native CLI subscription tool
   ('claude-cli' — shared by claude-code AND codex, both spawn a real OS
   process via runtime.ts's planAndActLive, the actual scarce resource), the
   managed lazygt Pro engine ('managed', via the shared ai-proxy), or a direct
   BYOK API key ('byok:<8-char-hash>' — one pool per distinct key, so
   unrelated keys never share a budget and one key's own rate limit is
   respected).

   dispatch() launches immediately when a pool AND the global cap
   (lazygt.agents.maxParallel) both have a free slot; otherwise it queues the
   mission (FIFO within priority) and emits `scheduler.queued` — additive
   context alongside, never a replacement for, the `mission.queued`
   lifecycle event agentsStore.tsx already emits at creation.

   Backoff: a run failing with a 429/rate-limit-shaped error pauses ITS OWN
   pool only (pools are independent) for an exponential window (30s base,
   10min cap, doubling per failure, reset on the next success). A backed-off
   pool is skipped by drain() even with a numerically free slot.

   Mostly event-driven — a pool's backoff/capacity is primarily re-checked on
   a mission settling or a new dispatch() call, so every dispatch() call
   opportunistically drains everything eligible first. A low-frequency
   periodic sweep (startPeriodicSweep, see the root-cause fix note below) is
   the one deliberate exception — a pure safety net, never the primary
   mechanism.

   Module-level singleton (zustand-style, no Context) — mirrors
   src/lib/brain/seedProgressStore.ts. _running/_backoff Maps are mutated in
   place, like agentsStore.tsx's own stopFlags/pauseFlags refs; _queue is
   reassigned wholesale on every change, like journal.ts's own _buffer.

   Conflict pre-flight (T1.6, spec §7.2): dispatch() additionally accepts
   opts.scopeInfo.runningMissions — the caller's OWN snapshot of currently
   running missions (agentsStore.tsx holds the full Mission list; this
   scheduler only ever tracked per-pool COUNTS, never which missions those
   counts refer to, so it cannot reconstruct that list itself). When
   provided, a mission that would otherwise launch immediately is instead
   checked (preflight.ts's checkConflicts) against that list; a scope
   overlap queues it (reason 'scope_conflict') instead of launching. Fully
   additive and backward-compatible: opts.scopeInfo is optional, and every
   existing call site (and every pre-T1.6 test) that never sets it sees
   byte-identical behavior, since the new code paths below are gated behind
   its presence.

   To know WHEN a scope-conflict-queued entry becomes launchable again
   ("drain it when the conflicting mission settles"), _runningMissionIds
   tracks every mission id currently occupying a launched slot (populated
   whenever a Mission is available at launch time — both the direct-dispatch
   path and drain()'s queued path always have one). A queued entry that
   carries conflictsWith is only eligible once none of those ids are in
   _runningMissionIds anymore — a cheap synchronous membership check, not a
   re-run of checkConflicts (whose async journal query is why the conflict
   check only ever happens once, at the moment a slot was first available —
   see dispatch()).

   Root-cause fix (real production defect, 2026-07-28 — a validated plan's
   next step queued for 'pool_full' 15s after the PREVIOUS step's own
   mission.completed event, then never started again for 2+ hours): a
   mission's launchFn (agentsStore.tsx's wrapped runMission() call) does not
   settle until the ENTIRE run finishes, including work runtime.ts performs
   AFTER the mission already reached a terminal, user-visible status
   (review/done/failed/cancelled) — orchestrator sub-agent fan-out and the
   automated tester/reviewer/security/judge evaluation pipeline both run
   AFTER runMission's onUpdate(status:'review') patch and BEFORE its promise
   resolves. Holding this pool slot for that entire unrelated tail (which can
   be slow, or even hang forever on a stuck/orphaned sub-agent process) starved
   every OTHER mission waiting on the same pool, with nothing to recover it:
   this file deliberately has no background timer (see below), so a slot that
   never numerically frees again is stuck for good.
   Fix, in two additive parts:
     1. releaseMissionSlot(missionId) — an idempotent EARLY release agentsStore
        .tsx now calls the moment a mission's status first leaves 'running'
        (review/done/failed/cancelled), decoupled from launchFn's full
        settlement. Whichever of that call or launchNow's own eventual
        .finally() runs first performs the real decRunning+drain; the other
        is a guaranteed no-op (see _missionPool's doc comment).
     2. A periodic sweep (startPeriodicSweep) — a deliberate, narrow exception
        to "no background timer" below: a safety net so a missed
        settle/dispatch notification (or a genuinely stuck slot that a crash
        left uncounted — see agentsStore.tsx's own reconciliation loop, which
        pairs getRunningMissionIds() against real mission state) can never
        stall a queue forever in silence. Also surfaces `scheduler.stalled`
        (never silent — mirrors scheduler.throttled's existing pattern) once
        per queued entry that has waited past STALLED_QUEUE_WAIT_MS.
