/* devPreview.ts — P46+P48 "signature experience": when a mission chain works
   on a web project, the user must automatically get a LIVE localhost
   preview next to the working agents — zero manual steps ("si le
   lazymanager travaille sur un site je dois voir le localhost et voir que
   des agents taffent dessus").

   BEFORE this module: useCanvasAutoComposition.ts's dev-server auto-detect
   only ever PASSIVELY probed a short list of common ports (3000/3001/5173/
   8080) and auto-added a preview once one answered. Nothing ever actually
   STARTED a dev server — a project whose dev server wasn't already running
   for some other reason (a terminal the user opened themselves, a previous
   session) never got a preview at all.

   This module adds the missing half: detect the project's own dev script
   (package.json `scripts.dev`) and the port it will bind, REUSE an already-
   answering port verbatim (never spawn a second server on top of one
   that's already up — see `reused` on {@link DevPreviewResult}), and
   otherwise spawn it via the app's EXISTING PTY infra (`platform.terminal.
   spawn`, the same real portable-pty TerminalView.tsx already drives) —
   deliberately no new Rust command.

   HOW A COMMAND ACTUALLY RUNS (important, non-obvious): `terminal_spawn`
   (src-tauri, wired through tauri.ts's `nativeTerminal.spawn`) takes only
   `cols`/`rows`/`cwd` — the `command`/`args` parameters TerminalView.tsx
   already passes it are NOT forwarded to Rust at all (see that file's own
   `platform.terminal.spawn('sh', [], { cwd })` call — 'sh' is a throwaway
   placeholder, never actually used to pick a shell binary). A PTY spawned
   this way is always just an interactive shell prompt; the only way to run
   a specific command in it is to `write()` the command line into it,
   exactly like a user typing it and pressing Enter. `spawnDevServerShell`
   below does exactly that: spawn the shell, then `write('npm run dev\r\n')`.

   SECURITY NOTE (deliberate, not an oversight): the only command line ever
   written into the spawned shell is `<packageManager> run dev` — the
   package manager is sniffed from a LOCKFILE NAME already committed to the
   project (package-lock.json/yarn.lock/pnpm-lock.yaml), never from
   arbitrary user/mission text, and `dev` is a literal npm-script invocation
   of whatever `package.json`'s OWN `scripts.dev` already says — this module
   never constructs or runs a shell command built from mission/agent output.

   REUSE-IF-RUNNING: before spawning anything, the resolved port is probed
   (same `no-cors` reachability technique PreviewNode.tsx/
   useCanvasAutoComposition.ts already use) — if something is already
   listening there, it is reused verbatim and NEVER tracked for idle-stop
   (see `reused` below): this module only ever kills a process it itself
   started.

   IDLE-STOP: a dev server this module spawned is stopped once its project
   has had no active (running) mission for `getIdleTimeoutMs` (default 30
   minutes, configurable per project) — driven by the caller invoking
   `noteProjectMissionActivity` on every mission-status tick (see
   useCanvasAutoComposition.ts's wiring). Deliberately NOT tied to the
   canvas hook's own mount/unmount lifecycle: a user navigating away from
   the Agent Canvas space must never kill a dev server whose project still
   has real work running — see that hook's own doc comment for why.

   Every I/O boundary (`readFile`/`readDir`/`probeReachable`/`fetchBodyStart`/
   `spawnShell`) is injectable via {@link DevPreviewDeps} — same "pure/
   testable independent of real fetch/timers" convention previewProbe.ts/
   previewBackoff.ts already follow — so the orchestration logic
   (reuse-if-running, dedup, idle-stop) is unit-tested without a real Tauri
   runtime.
