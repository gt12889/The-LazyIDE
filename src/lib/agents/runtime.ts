/* Agent runtime — Phase 2: real Claude Code agents in worktrees.
   Phase-1 scripted loop is preserved as the fallback (mock/web mode).

   Mode selection:
     - Tauri runtime + claude CLI available → real agent via agent_run
     - Otherwise → scripted fallback (browser demo, CI, no CLI)

   Event flow for live mode:
     agent_run (Rust) → agent://step/{id} events → planAndAct live
     → worktree diff → mission.status = 'review'

   Per-mission model routing: planAndAct's PRIMARY dispatch is keyed off the
   mission's own CHOSEN model (Mission.model, see classifyMissionModel)
   rather than the single globally-resolved getProviderMode() — a managed/
   OpenRouter id (contains '/') routes to planAndActManaged, a native Claude
   id/label (no '/') routes to planAndActLive, each gated on that SPECIFIC
   engine's own readiness (isManagedModelReady / isNativeModelReady) rather
   than the mutually-exclusive accessMode. This is what lets a user entitled
   to BOTH a Claude subscription and an active LazyPro plan at once (see
   modelPickerOptions.ts) actually get the engine they picked for THIS
   mission — a mismatched pick (e.g. a managed model chosen while Pro is
   inactive/out of credits) fails the mission early with a clear reason
   instead of silently running on the wrong engine with a mangled model id.
   getProviderMode()-based routing (isManagedAgentAvailable/
   isLiveAgentAvailable) remains a FALLBACK for calls with no classifiable
   model (legacy/low-level callers — see planAndAct).

   Brain-everywhere (native claude missions): memory reaches the agent in TWO
   ways now, not just one.
     1. Start injection (this file, below): brain recall + startup context are
        fetched once and folded into the initial task prompt — a snapshot as
        of mission start.
     2. Mid-mission MCP tool (Rust side, src-tauri/src/lib.rs agent_run /
        build_brain_mcp_config): when a brain exists for this project,
        agent_run additionally launches the mission with
        `--mcp-config <generated file> --strict-mcp-config` registering a
        `brain_search` tool backed by brain-search-server.mjs, so the agent
        can search memory AGAIN at any point mid-mission — a new sub-task, an
        unfamiliar file, a past decision — instead of being stuck with the
        start-of-mission snapshot. This is additive and fails open: when the
        brain/LazyBrain CLI/MCP script can't be resolved, agent_run silently
        skips the wiring and the mission runs exactly as it did before.

 * native mission with NO bound at all).
 *
 * 2 hours: generous enough to never cut off a legitimate long-running
 * documentation/refactor mission (the incident's own missions ran minutes,
 * not hours), short enough to reclaim a genuinely stuck process (a looping
 * tool call with no natural exit). Expressed in wall-clock time — the ONLY
 * signal the native engine can react to mid-run without a live cost/turn
 * count (see armDurationExceededTimer's own doc comment) — never dollars.
 * Exported so the choice is directly assertable in tests rather than a
