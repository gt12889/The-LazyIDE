/* managerEngine.ts — LazyManager LLM engine.
   Interprets natural language commands from the user and emits structured
   actions (create_agent, launch_mission, create_loop, stop_mission, etc.)
   that the UI executes via agentsStore.

   Routes the single planning turn through whichever backend matches the
   current provider mode (claude-code CLI, codex CLI, or the managed/pro
   ai-proxy) so it works regardless of which engine the user has configured.

   The manager has NO file tools — it reasons about the current state
   (agents, missions, brain) and outputs actions in a JSON block.

// | "opus" (see the action contract in buildManagerSystemPrompt below) — OR,
// since the modelId catalog wave, an exact catalog id (ManagerModelId,
// types.ts) naming one model precisely. The concrete id must belong to
// whichever id family the CURRENT provider mode's backend accepts: native
// Anthropic ids for claude-code/codex, the FULL OpenRouter catalog for the
// managed/Pro ai-proxy (see managedProvider.ts — it forwards the model
// string to the proxy as-is, with no tier translation, and managedAgent.ts's
// own model mapping, toNativeClaudeModel, only maps TOWARD native ids, never
// toward OpenRouter ids). Resolving the tier against the wrong family is
// exactly the "Modèle non supporté" blocker this fixes.
//
// modelId catalog wave (2026-07-28): the Pro rail used to be artificially
// narrowed to the 4 Anthropic entries (managedAnthropicModels in
// managerStreamCompletion.ts, used by toManagedModelId for the MANAGER'S
// OWN reasoning-model selection, a separate concern) — a model choosing e.g. "openai/gpt-5.4-mini" for a
// step was silently ignored and replaced by the tier default. Fixed by (1)
// widening the tier-word pool to the full OPENROUTER_MODELS catalog (only
// Anthropic ids ever contain "haiku"/"sonnet"/"opus" as a substring, so this
// is a pure widening, not a behavior change for existing tier hints), and
// (2) accepting an exact `modelId` ahead of the tier hint, validated against
// the CURRENT rail's real catalog — never silently substituted when unknown
// (see UnknownManagerModelIdError in managerModelResolve.ts).
// Implementation of resolveManagerModelId lives there (extracted 2026-08-28:
// cyclomatic complexity was 42, ratchet ceiling 12). Re-exported below.
//
// modelId is threaded through for: launch_mission, launch_best_of_n
// (its contest step), create_loop, create_draft, spawn_submissions'
// per-modification bag, and generate_plan steps — createOrchestrator,
// compileOrchestratorToIr, and launchOptsFromNode carry the field to
// the launched mission (see StepContract.modelId).

// ── PROMISE-STALL guard (2026-08-05, generalized night 2) ────────────
//
// BUG (real prod repro, dozens of times overnight): the manager replies with
// PROSE that announces an action ("Je supprime M16 et je jette son
// worktree.", "Je lance list_missions pour te donner l'état réel.") but
// emits NO <lazy_actions> block at all — the turn just ends there: nothing
// executes, nothing follows up. Once one exchange contains such a turn, the
// conversation HISTORY now contains an assistant message that "announced but
// never acted" — later turns visibly imitate that pattern (4 consecutive
// unactioned announcements observed live), because the model pattern-matches
// on its own prior turns. First occurrence correlated with grounded-lookup
// failures (journal.ts's journalQuery timing out, brain recall timing out —
// see ManagerContext.groundingFailureNote above for the "inject the error
// honestly" half of this fix); the SPECIFIC mechanism that turns a slow/failed
// lookup into a silently-abandoned exchange is runGroundedFollowUp's own
// catch block (agentsStore.tsx, "grounding turn ${turnCount + 1} failed"):
// when the grounded CONTINUATION call itself fails/times out, it returns
// `responseText: turnDisplayText(currentTurn)` — the text of the LAST
// turn that completed, which on the very first grounding round is just the
// announcement-only main turn — with no corresponding action ever emitted.
// That call site is in agentsStore.tsx, outside this fix's file perimeter
// (managerEngine.ts + brainSearchLoop.ts only — see the mission this fix
// shipped under).
//
// NIGHT-2 GENERALIZATION: the guard originally fired by pattern-matching the
// MANAGER's own response against a curated ANNOUNCEMENT_MARKERS list of
// French/English commitment openers ("Je lance", "Je supprime", ...). Every
// new phrasing the model happened to use ("Je place", "J'annule", "Je passe
// au merge", "Je force les approbations", ...) was a fresh miss to patch —
// guessing how the manager might phrase a commitment is an UNBOUNDED list by
// construction, and every miss cost the user a silently-dropped turn. Fixed
// by reading the USER's request instead of guessing the manager's prose: the
// user's own message for this turn (detectUserActionRequest below) is a
// much smaller, much more reliable signal — when the user clearly asked for
// an action ("lance la mission", "supprime M16", "peux-tu merge la PR ?")
// and the reply contains ZERO <lazy_actions>, something is wrong regardless
// of how (or whether) the reply narrates what it's doing: either the action
// should have been emitted, or the manager owes the user an explicit reason
// it isn't acting. The one carve-out (isClarifyingQuestion below): a reply
// that is itself asking the user something back is a legitimate zero-action
// turn and is never nudged. What IS fully fixed here, in the one place every
// manager turn (main turn AND every grounding round — both call
// runManagerTurn) funnels through: a turn that ends with ZERO actions after
// the user clearly asked for one never reaches the caller as-is —
// runManagerTurn itself spends one extra retry forcing the model to either
// emit the action for real or explicitly say why it isn't acting, so an
// unactioned request never gets a chance to enter conversation history and
// seed the imitation pattern in the first place.

// corrective attempt — real dogfood shows a weaker model still answers in
// prose roughly 60% of the time even after being shown the exact

// envelope), not a case where the model declined to act. Rather than a THIRD
// attempt at getting the SAME model to follow the convention in normal
// conversation (which already failed twice), this makes ONE short,
// narrowly-scoped completion whose ONLY job is translating the already-
// announced prose into the machine-actionable block.

 * Names are drawn from KNOWN_ACTION_TYPES (managerActionValidator.ts) so

 * actually accepts — a type missing from this list would still just fail
 * validation again on the repair call's own output, never a crash. Required-
 * field hints are a hand-maintained SUBSET covering the actions most likely

  // nothing relevant" turn after turn. Paying for a full engine search on
  // every turn to produce a block the model wasn't reliably using is pure

  // actions — the founder saw 8+ such messages in a single conversation,
  // every one of them describing a "problem" that had already been silently
  // fixed by the time the user read it. New policy: responseText carries NO
  // system notice at all when actions were ultimately obtained, by ANY
  // route (an ordinary first-pass reply, a nudge retry that produced real
  // actions, LAYER 1 salvage on either call, or the LAYER 2 repair call).
  // The ONLY case that still shows a notice is a TRUE failure — nudgeFailed
  // is already exactly that gate (nudge fired, the retry still produced
  // zero validated actions, and that reply is not itself a clarifying
  // question) — AND the repair call, if attempted, did not recover
  // anything either (!repairRecovered). console.warn diagnostics above (the
  // nudge-issued and repair-call-failed warnings) are untouched — this is
  // about the USER-visible transcript only; developers still see every
  // retry in the console regardless of outcome.
  // Bug 2b fix (LazyManager QA, 2026-08-07, "contradictory outcome" repro):
  // this used to APPEND baseResponseText after the failure notice, then
  // (this same fix) DROPPED it instead — baseResponseText, in that branch,
  // was always the model's own prose ANNOUNCING an action it never performed
  // ("I'll stop and permanently delete M72..."), and showing "nothing was
  // done" right next to that announcement read as two messages disagreeing
  // about whether anything happened.
  //
  // REVERSED (2026-08-15, founder repro): that reasoning assumed
  // baseResponseText is always an unexecuted announcement, but nudgeFailed
  // only proves "the guard THOUGHT an action was requested and none came
  // out" — it says nothing about what the text actually contains. Real
  // repro: "Réponds uniquement par OK." got detectUserActionRequest's
  // false-positive (see NON_VERB_MESSAGE_STARTERS' own 2026-08-15 fix note —
  // narrowed here, not removed, so a genuine unactioned request is still
  // caught), the model honestly answered "OK", and this branch DISCARDED
  // that real answer in favor of "[system] nothing was done" — the exact
  // "announces failure over a success" pattern this whole guard exists to
  // prevent. Dropping the text was never actually required to avoid the
  // 2026-08-07 contradiction either: prepending the notice (not appending)
  // already makes the ORDER read as "here's the honest status, here's what
  // the model said" rather than the reverse, and a genuinely empty reply
  // (nothing exploitable to show) still degrades to the notice alone. New
  // policy, matching the founder's explicit instruction: the failure notice
  // is shown ONLY for a true failure (nudgeFailed && !repairRecovered, same
  // gate as before) and, whenever the model's own text is non-empty, stands
  // ALONGSIDE it rather than replacing it — never silently discarding a real
  // reply just because the PROMISE-STALL guard also fired on the same turn.
