/* evaluator.ts — Mission evaluation pipeline (tester + reviewer + security + judge).
   After an implementer run produces a diff, this module spawns evaluator sub-runs
   and aggregates into a JudgeVerdict. Dispatch is mode-aware, mirroring how
   missions themselves run (see runtime.ts's planAndAct):

     - claude-code / codex (native CLI, Tauri)  -> evaluateLive, via agent_run
     - managed (Pro subscription, Tauri)        -> evaluateManaged, via the
                                                     managed provider + run_shell
     - pro / live-key / mock (Tauri, no engine) -> evaluateScripted, real test
                                                     runner but no real reviewer
     - no Tauri runtime at all                  -> buildUnavailableVerdict()

   HONESTY CONTRACT:
   - Evaluation is NEVER fabricated. Every path either runs a real sub-agent
     (native CLI or managed LLM) and a real test command, or returns a
     clearly-labelled placeholder verdict with passed=false explaining what's
     missing. No path invents a passing score.
   - evaluateManaged's tester role never guesses pass/fail counts: it reports
     the real run_shell exit code, and only includes counts when they can be
     parsed from the command's own output.

 * DEFECT C (2026-07 in-app QA): agent_run (agent.rs) always emits BOTH
 * agent://done and agent://error together whenever the CLI process fails
 * (non-zero exit code, or is_error in its result line) — done carries only
 * the bare exit code, error carries the real reason (stderr output, or the
 * is_error summary). This function used to resolve as soon as EITHER event
 * arrived, so whichever happened to be delivered first won: in practice
 * that was always the done event (emitted first on the Rust side), which
 * meant the generic "Evaluator exited with code N" always won the race and
 * silently discarded the error event's actual diagnostic text — every
 * native sub-agent (tester/reviewer/security/judge) failed with that exact
 * uninformative message no matter what actually went wrong underneath.
 *
 * Fix: a failing done event no longer resolves immediately — it records a
 * generic fallback message and gives the companion error event a brief
 * grace window to arrive and overwrite it with the real reason (which it
 * always does, per agent_run's contract above). If no error event shows up
 * within that window (contract violation / edge case), the generic message
 * is used so this can never hang forever — HONESTY CONTRACT: always settle
 * with the best information available, never silently wait forever.
 *
 * Also fixes a related hang: previously, if invoke('agent_run', ...) itself
 * rejected synchronously (e.g. ensure_repo_in_project's path validation
 * failing before the Rust command ever emits a done/error event), the
 * promise below was never resolved and this function — and the whole
 * evaluator pipeline awaiting it — hung indefinitely instead of surfacing
 * an honest failure.

/**
 * Aggregates tester/reviewer/security/judge ReviewerVerdicts into the final
 * JudgeVerdict.
 *
 * DEFECT 1 (2026-07 acceptance test) — distinguishing "the change is bad /
 * tests failed" from "the evaluator could not run the tests":
 * A sub-agent flagged `inconclusive` hit an evaluator-INFRASTRUCTURE failure
 * (it could not run at all — agent_run rejected, plan-mode/CLI blocked
 * execution, the test shell failed, the worktree path was invalid). That is
 * NOT evidence the change is wrong, so an inconclusive sub-agent is treated as
 * a NON-VOTE here: it never counts as a rejection and never pulls the score
 * toward 0. This is what stops the pipeline from scoring a perfectly good
 * change 0 / request_changes just because the evaluator itself couldn't run.
 *
 *   - risk:   from the judge's JSON, falling back to the security verdict.
 *   - passed: the judge is authoritative WHEN IT ACTUALLY PRODUCED A VERDICT
 *             (conclusive); when the judge itself could not run, fall back to
 *             the consensus of the conclusive non-judge reviewers.
 *   - score:  the judge's own score when the judge is conclusive; otherwise
 *             the average of the CONCLUSIVE reviewers' scores; else 0.
 *
 * Honest limit: the judge is an LLM, so its OWN score/verdict can still be
 * mis-set if it penalizes a change for an inconclusive reviewer despite being
 * told not to (see buildJudgeTask). The deterministic guarantees above only
 * cover what this function controls — non-vote exclusion and the judge-down
 * fallback; the primary defense against the observed bug is running the
 * sub-agents with an execution-capable permission in the first place (see
 * runEvaluatorAgent) so the tester is not inconclusive at all.
 *
 * R11 (judge-score honesty rule) — a SECOND, narrower dishonesty this
 * function used to have: `judgeConclusive` above only means "the judge
 * sub-agent didn't throw" — it says NOTHING about whether the judge's raw
 * text actually PARSED as JSON. `parseReviewerResult`'s heuristic text
 * fallback (no `{...}` found, or `JSON.parse` failed) still manufactures a
 * `verdict` by scanning for the word "approve"/"reject" in the raw text, but
 * NEVER sets a `score`. The old code trusted that shaky heuristic verdict for
 * `passed` regardless, and fell back to averaging every reviewer's score —
 * which, when EVERY reviewer's response was equally unparsable prose (score
 * absent everywhere), silently became `0`: a fabricated « Verdict 0/100 » on
 * a mission the heuristic itself had just called "approve" (passed=true).
 *
 * Fixed with one additional gate, `judgeScoreParsable` (the judge is
 * conclusive AND produced a real numeric `score` from actual JSON — not the
 * text heuristic): only THEN is the judge's own `verdict` trusted for
 * `passed`; otherwise `passed` falls back to the SAME conclusive-non-judge
 * consensus rule the "judge inconclusive" case already used (reused
 * verbatim, not a second implementation). Likewise `score` only trusts the
 * judge's number when `judgeScoreParsable`; otherwise the conclusive
 * reviewers' average when one exists; only when NEITHER exists does `score`
 * fall back to the `0` placeholder — and THAT fallback is the one honestly
 * flagged via `scoreUnavailable: true`, so the UI (VerdictChip,

// MAJEUR (R3 dogfood, 2026-07): a repo with no `npm test` script (or no
// package.json at all) makes BOTH the managed tester (runManagedTester's
// `npm test` via run_shell) and the live tester (the LLM sub-agent asked to
// "run the test suite") fail STRUCTURALLY — there is no test command to run,
// full stop. Before this fix that structural absence was indistinguishable
// from a real test failure: the managed path scored it ~20 (npm's "Missing
// script" exit reported the same way as a real failing exit code) and the
// live path let an LLM improvise a low-confidence verdict — either way
// dragging the judge's score down to ~20-30 and forcing every merge on that
// project to need a manual override, even for a perfectly good change.
//
// ReviewerVerdict.inconclusive exists for exactly this class of problem
// (evaluator-infrastructure failure, not a code defect — see DEFECT 1's
// aggregateVerdict doc comment) — this check makes the tester report
// inconclusive UP FRONT, before ever attempting to run anything, instead of
// discovering the absence via a failing command's exit code.

 * independent TS check here since neither the managed tester (run_shell
 * 'npm test' directly) nor the live tester (an LLM sub-agent) goes through
