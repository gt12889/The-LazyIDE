/* silenceWatchdog.ts — Silence watchdog for RUNNING missions.

   Real incident (M72, observed 2026-08-07): a mission ran `next build` in
   its worktree (managed engine, toolRuntime.ts's Bash tool), the build
   exited 1, the observation was appended to the mission's actionTimeline
   ("Observation: [exit 1] ... Compiled successfully ... Linting and
   chec…"), and then the agent's NEXT model turn never returned — no error,
   no further action event, nothing. The mission stayed `running` at 34%
   progress for 1535s (~25.6min) until a human noticed and stopped it
   manually.

   Two existing pieces already understood "silence" — neither of them acted
   on it:
     1. The UI's own display heartbeat — MissionNode.tsx's
        `isHeartbeatStale`/`HEARTBEAT_STALE_THRESHOLD_MS` (90s), keyed off
        `mission.updatedMs` (bumped by every journal write, itself
        downstream of every `onUpdate` call in runtime.ts's runMission). It
        literally renders "agent silent · Ns" — a soft visual cue, not a
        fault threshold; nothing consumed it to actually stop the mission.
     2. `activityWatchdog.ts` (lib/models) — a real, tested silence+ceiling
        timer already used for the assistant chat path (claudeCodeProvider's
        buildRunTurn). Its own doc comment explicitly says mission runs
        don't need it, "they already tolerate open-ended silence up to
        their wall-clock cap" — an assumption this incident falsifies:
        `contract.maxDurationMs` is optional and, in the observed case,
        unset, so there was NO cap of any kind once the agent went silent.

   This module builds on (2) directly — reuses `createActivityWatchdog`
   rather than inventing a parallel timer primitive — and adds the
   mission-specific piece: a threshold tuned for agent-turn silence (not
   chat-turn silence) and a recovery decision that reuses recovery.ts's
   evaluateRecovery instead of inventing a parallel retry-counting rule.
   See runtime.ts's runMission for the wiring (ping()/dispose(), the
   pause/awaiting-approval eligibility check, and the onTimeout handler).

/**
 * How long a RUNNING mission may go with no activity (no `onUpdate` call —
 * see runtime.ts's wiring) before the watchdog treats it as stalled.
 *
 * Chosen from the observed incident: the mission sat silent for 1535s
 * (~25.6min) before a human intervened. A normal agent turn can
 * legitimately take minutes (a large tool call, a slow model backend), so
 * this must stay well above:
 *   - the UI's own 90s "agent silent" heartbeat label
 *     (HEARTBEAT_STALE_THRESHOLD_MS in MissionNode.tsx) — a soft visual
 *     cue shown the moment things go quiet, not a fault threshold;
 *   - activityWatchdog.ts's own DEFAULT_SILENCE_MS (60s) — tuned for a
 *     CHAT turn, where a human is watching live and expects sub-minute
 *     responsiveness; an autonomous mission turn (a build, a test suite,
 *     a large refactor) has no such expectation.
 * Firing at either of those would be trigger-happy and would abort
 * perfectly healthy long tool calls.
 *
 * 10 minutes is generous enough to absorb a genuinely slow-but-alive turn
 * while still bounding the wasted-slot window: on the FIRST strike the
 * watchdog gives the mission one more full window rather than failing
 * outright (see evaluateSilenceRecovery), so the worst case is two
 * threshold windows (~20min) before the mission is forced to a terminal
 * state — a large cut from the observed ~25.6min unbounded hang, without
 * being so short it fires mid-build.

 * harmful here — a healthy mission legitimately runs far longer than
 * that). 24h is not expected to ever fire in practice: it exists only as
 * a defensive backstop against a `ping()` call site being missed, well
 * outside setTimeout's ~24.8-day signed-32-bit ceiling.

 * Pure: decides what the watchdog does on a silence strike, reusing
 * recovery.ts's evaluateRecovery instead of inventing a parallel
 * retry-counting rule. The synthetic stage's error message contains
 * "timeout" so it lands on evaluateRecovery's environmentalPolicy (bounded
 * retry then block) rather than its generic defaultPolicy — a silence
 * timeout genuinely IS an environmental failure (network hang, wedged
 * backend), not a task-shaped one.
 *
 * `strikeCount` is the number of PRIOR silence strikes already recorded
 * for this mission (0 on the first strike, 1 on the second, …). maxAttempts
 * is fixed at 1: exactly one retry ("wait one more window") is allowed
 * before the decision becomes terminal — see runtime.ts's wiring for why a
 * watchdog firing mid-run cannot safely do more than that (no way to
 * cancel and relaunch an in-flight managed turn without risking two
 * concurrent loops writing the same worktree — "retry" here means giving
 * the existing run one more silence window, never a fresh relaunch).
