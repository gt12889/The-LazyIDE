/* lazyReasoningBlocks/chainOfDraft.ts — Chain-of-Draft reasoning directive.
   Appends a concise reasoning directive to the system prompt, asking the
   agent to produce ≤5-word intermediate reasoning steps instead of verbose
   chain-of-thought.

   Inspired by ReasonBlocks' Chain-of-Draft, adapted for lazygt's ReAct loop.
   The directive is appended to the system prompt as a [LAZYREASONING] block.
