/* actionClassifier.ts — Explicit action classification for universal gating.
 *
 * Phase 2 of the orchestration overhaul: every manager action passes through
 * evaluateActionGate before execution. This module provides the definitive
 * classification of all manager action types into three tiers:
 *
 * - SAFE: read-only / display-only actions, plus REVERSIBLE canvas and
 *   plan-authoring operations (create_draft, chain_agents, generate_plan,
 *   ...) — the manager's actual day-to-day work. Auto-allowed in every
 *   autonomy mode except manual.
 * - SENSITIVE: actions that consume budget or touch real running execution
 *   (launch a mission, execute a plan, approve/reject a mission). Require
 *   approval in supervised/manual mode; auto-allowed in YOLO.
 * - DESTRUCTIVE: irreversible actions (delete_mission, close_project,
 *   clear_canvas in 'delete' mode). Require approval even in YOLO mode.
 *
 * Gate-usability fix (2026-07-28): the previous classification put ordinary
 * canvas-authoring actions (create_draft, chain_agents, generate_plan,
 * move_node, ...) in SENSITIVE, which meant the manager's own core
 * workflow — draft a node, chain two agents, sketch a plan — asked for
 * approval on every single step, with no surface to actually approve from
 * (see evaluateActionGate's 'ask' branch, previously a dead end). Reclassified
 * so only actions that spend money or touch real execution require approval;
 * reversible canvas/plan-authoring moves to SAFE.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for classification — autonomyMode.ts's
 * SAFE_ACTIONS and SENSITIVE_ACTIONS sets are kept for backward compatibility
 * but this module is what the universal gate path consults.
