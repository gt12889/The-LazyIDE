/* fleetHygiene.ts — P58: automatic fleet hygiene.

   FOUNDER DIRECTIVE (verbatim): "hygiène naturelle et auto, fais en sorte
   que l'app soit opti et sature pas, ça peut pas freeze c'est pas normal.
   Chaque action manuelle prise pendant l'audit = une chose qui manque dans
   l'app." A real audit session needed a human to manually tell the manager
   to clean up 4 duplicate retry attempts, months-old dead missions, stale
   signals, duplicate preview placeholders, and e2e-scratch canvas debris —
   every one of those is now a standing rule here instead of a one-off
   manual cleanup.

   Every rule in this module is a PURE function over plain data fixtures —
   no I/O, no React, no journal/canvas imports — so the whole rule set is
   unit-testable in isolation (see src/__tests__/fleetHygiene.test.ts) and
   safely composable by whatever wiring calls it (agentsStore.tsx's
   `runFleetHygieneSweep`, the one real caller today).

   HARD SAFETY FLOOR (never relaxed by any rule below): a mission is only
   ever a candidate for (a)/(a2)/(b)/(c) when its OWN `status` is exactly
   'done', 'cancelled', or 'failed' — 'running', 'queued', and 'review' are
   NEVER inspected by the archive rules at all, structurally, regardless of
   age, title collisions, or anything else a caller passes in. This mirrors
   the standing product rule this feature was built under: "NEVER touch
   running/review/pending-decision missions." 'cancelled' graduated out of
   this untouchable set (worktree-leak follow-up, see (a2) below) — a
   cancelled mission is a mission the user (or the system) already decided
   to stop; leaving it un-archivable forever just because it never merged
   was a real product gap (cancelled missions never auto-archived,
   confirmed piling up in real fleets), not a safety requirement.

   Rules implemented (spec P58):
     (a) planMissionArchival  — done/merged missions, grace period (§ grace)
     (a2) planMissionArchival — cancelled missions, own grace period (worktree-
                                leak follow-up, reason 'cancelled_grace_period')
     (b) planMissionArchival  — failed missions superseded by a newer
                                same-title retry (reason 'superseded')
     (c) planMissionArchival  — failed missions stale 7+ days with no retry
                                at all (reason 'stale')
     (d) purgeStaleSignals    — anything keyed by a missionId that no longer
                                resolves to a live (non-archived) mission
     (e) dedupePreviewSurfaces — at most one preview surface per project
     (f) findTestCanvasArtifacts — canvas drafts/notes that are test debris
     (f) planTestScratchProjectClosure — 2026-07-22 memory-pressure incident
                                fix: rule (f) also sweeps the OPEN-PROJECTS
                                registry, not just canvas artifacts. A
                                leftover e2e/soak-scratch project left open
                                after its own test run can auto-spawn a dev
                                server later (devPreview.ts's auto-detect),
                                into a scratch cwd that no longer matters —
                                exactly the incident this rule closes.
     (g) planTransientSurfaceTtl — worktree-leak follow-up (Fix 4): a preview
                                surface that has NEVER been configured with a
                                real address, once it has sat past its own
                                TTL — "dead preview, server long gone" in its
                                most literal form. Scoped to `kind ===
                                'preview'` only; never a 'terminal' surface,
                                never a macro/loop/draft/note (see the
                                function's own doc comment for the full
                                boundary).
     (h) planIdleTerminalClosure — memory-pressure follow-up (Fix 2): a
                                terminal surface with no PTY output AND not
                                selected/focused for its own TTL. Scoped to
                                `kind === 'terminal'` only; fails closed on
                                unknown activity (never guesses a fresh
                                terminal is idle).

/**
 * Rule (g): TTL for a TRANSIENT preview surface — one that has NEVER been
 * configured with a real address (`!hasAddress`, same check rule (e) uses)
 * — once it has sat for at least `config.transientSurfaceTtlMs`. This is
 * "dead preview, server long gone" in its most literal form: no server was
 * ever pointed at it in the first place.
 *
 * Scoped to `kind === 'preview'` ONLY (and an absent `kind`, from a caller
 * that has not been updated to supply it, is treated the same as
 * `'terminal'` — never touched). A `'terminal'` surface has no address
 * concept at all, so `hasAddress` is always false for one; without this
 * guard every idle-but-wanted terminal on the canvas would look identically
 * "dead" and get swept by age alone, which would be wrong.
 *
 * A surface that DOES carry a real address is never touched by this rule,
 * regardless of age. Confirming "this one WAS alive and its server died"
 * needs a live reachability signal this pure module has no access to
 * (PreviewNode.tsx's own client-local probe is never persisted to the
 * canvas store) — the existing event-driven removal on an explicit
 * `devPreview:serverStopped` (useCanvasAutoComposition.ts) already covers
 * the one case that IS tracked today (an auto-detected dev server lazygt
 * itself started and later stopped).
 *
 * Same "unknown age -> never touch, never guess" honesty as rule (a): a
 * surface with no known `placeholderSinceMs` is skipped, never assumed
 * expired.
 *
 * Never touches macros, loops/workflows, drafts, or notes — this rule only
 * ever inspects `HygienePreviewSurface`, a shape drafts/notes/macros/loops
 * are never mapped onto (see `planFleetHygiene`'s wiring).

// explicitly excludes them (a terminal has no "address" concept), and
// nothing else in the app ever closed one the user didn't explicitly click
// "x" on. A canvas left open for days with a handful of forgotten terminals
// keeps every one of their PTYs + xterm buffers resident indefinitely.

/**
 * Rule (h): terminal surfaces safe to auto-close because they look
 * ABANDONED — no PTY output for at least `config.idleTerminalTtlMs`, AND
 * not selected/focused within that same window either. Conservative by
 * construction:
 *   - Scoped to `kind === 'terminal'` ONLY (mirrors rule (g)'s own guard);
 *     an absent/other kind is never touched.
 *   - `lastOutputAtMs` unknown -> never eligible (fails closed, same
 *     "unknown -> never touch, never guess" convention as rule (a)/(g) —
 *     see HygienePreviewSurface.lastOutputAtMs's own doc comment).
 *   - A RECENT focus inside the window always protects the surface
 *     regardless of how quiet its output has been — a human sitting at an
 *     idle prompt, about to type, is exactly the case this must never
 *     auto-close. `lastFocusedAtMs` unknown does NOT protect (see that
 *     field's own doc comment).
 *
 * Never inspects "does this terminal have a running foreground process"
 * directly — this pure module has no OS-level process-tree signal to read.
 * A real foreground process that is still producing output keeps refreshing
 * `lastOutputAtMs`, which is the best available proxy without adding a
