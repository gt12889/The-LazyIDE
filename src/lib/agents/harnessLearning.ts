/* harnessLearning.ts — The harness-compiles loop (Phase C).

   Turns recurring journal pathologies (from frictionMiner) into LEARNED
   harness rules, stored as brain neurons in `trial` status, then lets the
   evalGate-style evidence decide promotion to `proven` or eviction.

   This closes the deck's "the harness compounds" loop in lazygt's own data
   model:
     repeated mistake → anti-pattern entry (frictionMiner)
       → NEW rule neuron, status=trial, provenance=missionId
         → injected at the next mission (see harnessRules.ts)
           → brain.recalled carries the rule's nodeId
             → joined to mission.failed of the SAME mission
               → helped/harmed evidence
                 → trial → proven | evicted

   Design contract:
   - A rule is distilled ONLY from candidates backed by real journal
     evidence (frictionMiner's mineFrictionsFromJournal output). No
     synthetic rules.
   - A learned rule that already exists (same body, any status) is never
     duplicated — it is skipped.
   - Eviction is a DATA decision (status=evicted), not a deletion: the
     rule stays in the graph for audit, which is a differentiator.
   - Never throws to callers; a brain failure just means no rule captured.
