/* artifactEnvelopeLeak.ts — shared <artifact> result-envelope leak stripper
   (2026-08 QA, extracted the same way reasoningLeak.ts was: a self-contained
   sibling module rather than growing managerEngine.ts, so the single call
   site there only ever needs a one-line import + a one-line call — see this
   repo's own precedent for why: reasoningLeak.ts's header explains the same
   "factor it out so call sites share one rule instead of drifting" reason,
   and managerEngine.ts is currently being edited concurrently for unrelated
   model-rail/billing work, so keeping this fix's footprint there minimal
   avoids stepping on that in-flight change).

   Real leak (Cockpit manager panel, live):
     ...ce qui doit être corrigé. <artifact type="application/json"
     id="query-m7"> {"type": "query_miss...
   and, from the same root cause, a stray closing fragment observed
   elsewhere in the same session (a mission list preview):
     M7"} </artifact> ~3 crédits

   Some backends wrap a structured result in a raw `<artifact type="..."
   id="...">{...json payload...}</artifact>` envelope. This is NOT lazygt's
   own <lazy_actions> convention (managerEngine.ts's stripActionBlock) and
   never legitimately reaches a manager-facing surface — same leak CLASS as
   the native `<function_calls>`/`<invoke>` tool-call XML managerEngine.ts's
   sanitizeManagerDisplayText already strips (its own LEAKED_TOOL_CALL_TAGS
   / stripCompleteTagBlocks / stripUnclosedTrailingTag), so this module
   reuses that exact same two-pass technique (complete block, then
   unterminated trailing block) instead of inventing a parallel one, plus a
   third pass for the "closing tag survived, opening tag did not" shape
   (mirrors managerEngine.ts's stripBareActionsJsonForDisplay handling of
   the analogous malformed <lazy_actions> case, 2026-08-12 QA — that one
   wraps a JSON ARRAY, this one wraps a JSON OBJECT).
