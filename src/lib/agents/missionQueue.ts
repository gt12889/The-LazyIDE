/* missionQueue.ts — Durable mission queue with stage state persistence.
   Replaces the fire-and-forget addMission() → runMission() pattern with
   a queue that persists execution state, enabling crash recovery and
   resume-from-last-stage.

   Inspired by Millrace's durable queue concept — adapted for lazygt's
   Tauri/TS stack using the filesystem for persistence.
