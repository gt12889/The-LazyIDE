/* projectReport.ts — pure per-project « Rapport » read-model (Agent Canvas
   W8b follow-up): everything a future report page needs about a project's
   COMPLETED missions, derived exclusively from journal events. The page UI
   itself ships in a later wave — this module is only the derivation.

   Same honesty contract as missionHistory.ts (this module's sibling —
   grouping/duration/token/chain helpers are imported from there, never
   re-derived): a field that cannot be derived from real events is absent or
   null, never fabricated.

   Artifacts provenance: Mission.proofs (the ProofArtifact[] an agent
   actually attached at runtime — screenshots/test_run/command_output/
   behavior_diff stored under `<project>/.lazy/artifacts/<missionId>/`, see
   types.ts's ProofArtifact block) is read out of the journal's OWN data:
   the LATEST mission.updated/mission.created event carrying a full Mission
   snapshot in `payload.mission` (eventTypes.ts's T0.5 mechanism — the same
   snapshot `missions_current` is built from, so a mission pruned from the
   live store still reports the proofs its last snapshot carried). Each
   entry is shape-checked against the ProofArtifact union's per-kind
   REQUIRED fields before being trusted — a malformed entry is dropped, not
   patched.

 * SOLE call site that ever sets `status: 'done'`, and it always pairs that
 * with a `mission.approved` journal row — see that function's own header).
 * Since `history.events` is chronologically ascending and a normally-
 * reviewed-then-approved mission emits `mission.completed` BEFORE the later
 * `mission.approved`, naively taking the FIRST SUCCESS_TERMINAL_TYPES match
 * (the pre-fix behavior) always picked `mission.completed` — meaning
 * `mergedToday`/`mergedTodayCount` counted "agent run finished today"
 * (still awaiting review, or even later REJECTED) as "mergée", never
 * requiring an actual merge at all. Preferring `mission.approved` when
 * present (regardless of array order) fixes both the terminal type AND the
 * completion timestamp to the REAL merge moment; `completedMissions` itself
 * still includes a review-only (never approved) mission — its cost/token/
 * duration totals are real and worth reporting — but `mergedToday` for it
 * is honestly `false` until an actual `mission.approved` row exists.
