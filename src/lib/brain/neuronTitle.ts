/* neuronTitle — display-layer sanitizer for neuron titles.

   ROOT CAUSE (Brain space defect, 2026-08): a neuron derived from a mission
   prompt can carry raw HTML markup straight from that prompt (e.g. a mission
   asking to write a file containing `<title>lazygt demo</title>`), and some
   upstream step then hard-truncates the resulting title at a fixed character
   offset with no regard for where that offset lands — landing mid-tag and
   with no ellipsis: "...avec un <title>lazygt demo</titl". Both the leaked
   markup and the raw cut are display bugs: nothing recovers text that was
   already cut off upstream, but the render layer must never show a `<tag>`
   fragment, and any truncation IT performs must land on a word boundary and
   carry a real ellipsis character.

   Every neuron-title render site (Brain detail panel, "new items" timeline
   strip, wiki cluster tree, search results dropdown — see BrainWiki.tsx,
   BrainTimeline.tsx, WikiTree.tsx, BrainControls.tsx) must go through
   `formatNeuronTitle` rather than rendering the raw field directly. */

const ELLIPSIS = '…';

/** Matches a well-formed tag (`<title>`, `</title>`, `<br/>`, ...) — always
    has both the opening `<` and a closing `>`. */
const COMPLETE_TAG_RE = /<[^<>]*>/g;

/** Matches a dangling, unclosed tag fragment at the very end of the string
    (the shape a mid-tag hard-truncation leaves behind, e.g. `</titl`). */
const TRAILING_PARTIAL_TAG_RE = /<[^<>]*$/;

/**
 * Strips HTML-like markup from `raw` so no `<tag>` fragment — complete or
 * dangling — ever reaches the DOM as visible text. Collapses the whitespace
 * left behind by a removed tag and trims the result.
