 *           model applies changes itself via tools and narrates/summarizes
 *           (see systemPrompts.ts's MODE_BASE_PROMPTS.edit and chat.rs's

 *           treats the raw stream as literal replacement code.
 * 'transform' — single-shot, non-agentic code transform (Ctrl+K inline-edit,
 *           auto-fix). The caller inlines all needed context into the
 *           prompt and treats the ENTIRE response as literal replacement
 *           code, so the model must return ONLY code — no tools, no
