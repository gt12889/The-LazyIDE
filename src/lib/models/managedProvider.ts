/* managedProvider — lazygt-managed model backend (Pro tier).

   Calls the `ai-proxy` Supabase Edge Function with the user's JWT, streaming
   the proxy's plain-text response body into an AsyncIterable<string>.

   The proxy handles auth, the subscription/credit gate, the upstream model
   call (via OpenRouter), and usage metering + credit decrement. This client
   forwards the conversation, the selected OpenRouter model id, and the
   reasoning effort level.

   When the managed key is not configured server-side, the proxy returns 503
   with code "managed_unavailable"; we throw a typed error so the gateway can
   fall back to the user's other backend and surface a friendly notice.

   Do NOT import from anthropicProvider, claudeCodeProvider, or cliBackendProvider
   here — this file is the managed path only. assistantToolLoop.ts is the one
   deliberate exception (see "ReAct loop" below): it is provider-agnostic and
   already shared by the other three chat providers.

   ReAct loop (brain directives + general tool directives):
   - streamChatImpl delegates to assistantToolLoop.ts's withAssistantToolLoop
     (imported under the withBrainSearchLoop alias — same convention as
     anthropicProvider.ts/claudeCodeProvider.ts/cliBackendProvider.ts) instead
     of hand-rolling its own round loop. resolveManagedTurnContext resolves
     the session + builds the static proxy-body parts ONCE; buildManagedRunTurn
     wraps streamProxyBody as the per-round callback the shared loop drives —
     so auth headers, model id, and usage/credit metering all stay
     centralized in streamProxyBody, never duplicated here.
   - FIX (2026-07 live defect): before this, managedProvider ran its OWN loop
     that only understood BRAIN_SEARCH / BRAIN_QUERY_CSS / BRAIN_NEIGHBOURS
     (via brainTool.ts's parseBrainDirective). General tool directives
     (WEB_SEARCH, WEB_FETCH, READ_FILE, READ_DIR, SEARCH_CODE, GIT_*) taught
     by systemPrompts.ts's ASSISTANT_TOOL_GROUNDING fell straight through as
     unrecognized prose in managed ("Pro · géré") mode: the directive line
     leaked into the visible answer and the model, never receiving a real
     tool result, hallucinated the rest of its response in that same turn.
     withAssistantToolLoop already handles BOTH directive families (see
     parseUnifiedDirective) with the exact same brain-directive behavior this
     file used to hand-roll (same describeBrainDirective/executeBrainDirective
     primitives, same dedup/nudge/forced-final contract) — this file's
     previous MAX_BRAIN_SEARCH_ROUNDS=3 constant is retired in favor of
     assistantToolLoop.ts's shared MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS, so all four chat
     providers now share one round budget.
   - managedProviderEvents.ts's streamChatEventsImpl mirrors this exact same
     delegation with withAssistantToolLoopEvents, reusing this file's
     resolveManagedTurnContext/buildManagedRunTurn instead of duplicating the
     session/baseBody setup a second time.

   Real-usage marker (billing trust — see ai-proxy's settleAndRecord):
   - After settlement, ai-proxy appends one final `\x1b[usage]{...}` line to
     the stream carrying the REAL settled token counts + charged USD cost —
     see parseUsageMarker below. It is an out-of-band channel multiplexed
     into the same plain-text stream, the same convention already used for
     `\x1b[reasoning]` lines (see brainSearchLoop.ts's OUT_OF_BAND_MARKER,
     which strips it from the interactive chat's visible UI text).
   - streamManagedAgentTurn (used by managedAgent.ts's agent loop) parses it
     directly and reports it via the optional `onUsage` callback instead of
     yielding it, so managedAgent.ts can prefer real settled usage over its
     ceil(chars/4) estimate for onMetrics.
   - streamProxyBody (used by the interactive assistant chat, via
     buildManagedRunTurn) captures it the same way to feed costStore's
     addUsage with real token counts.
   - Absent (older ai-proxy deployment) or malformed → both call sites fall
     back to the pre-existing chars/4 estimate, unchanged.
   - T0.4: when missionId/projectId are supplied (managedAgent.ts's calls
     always provide them), streamManagedAgentTurn additionally emits a
     corrective journal spend.tokens event (source 'settled') carrying the
     settled totals — independent of managedAgent.ts's own per-turn
     mission.step/spend.tokens instrumentation, so the journal always has
     the ai-proxy's authoritative figure even if a caller's own estimate
     bookkeeping differs.

 * chunk IN ISOLATION, with no buffering across chunks. A `ReadableStream`
 * chunk boundary has no relationship to the marker's own boundaries, so a
 * chunk could split RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of `\x1b[usage]{"inputTokens":1140,
 * "outputTokens":536,"costUsd":0.0567}`: the first chunk's tail
 * (`\x1b[usage]{"inputTokens":11`) DID start with the marker prefix and was

 * chunk's visible text with no separator, producing exactly the observed
 * `…prêt.40,"outputTokens":536,"costUsd":0.0567}` leak in the manager bubble.
 *
 * Fix: only ever classify a line once it is known COMPLETE (terminated by a
