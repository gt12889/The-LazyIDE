/* brainSearchLoop — shared ReAct brain_search shim for all providers.

   When brain_search is not in req.tools, withBrainSearchLoop is a transparent
   pass-through: single turn, no extra calls, identical to the pre-shim path.

   When brain_search is present:
   - Loops up to MAX_BRAIN_SEARCH_ROUNDS (3).
   - Detects BRAIN_SEARCH: <query> directives in each turn's text.
   - Deduplicates queries (normalized: trim + lowercase) to prevent loops.
   - Forces a final prose answer when max rounds are reached or a duplicate
     is detected.
   - Strips reasoning-channel lines, the managed proxy's final \x1b[usage]
     real-usage marker, and BRAIN_SEARCH directives from UI output, even
     when a marker appears mid-line (not just at line start) — reasoning-
     capable models often emit them inline with no leading newline.
   - Yields a clean status line per search instead of the raw directive.
   - Bounds every brain-recall call to BRAIN_RECALL_TIMEOUT_MS (withTimeout)
     so a slow or hung platform command degrades the turn gracefully instead
     of blocking it — the backend's own ~30s command timeout is a last-resort
     safety net, not the UX budget.

   SUPERSEDED for chat providers (2026-07): claudeCodeProvider, cliBackendProvider,
   and anthropicProvider no longer call the withBrainSearchLoop /
   withBrainSearchLoopEvents functions defined below directly — they now get
   their ReAct loop from assistantToolLoop.ts's withAssistantToolLoop /
   withAssistantToolLoopEvents (which extends this module's brain-directive
   handling with general tool directives: WEB_SEARCH, READ_FILE, ...),
   imported under a `withBrainSearchLoop`/`withBrainSearchLoopEvents` LOCAL
   ALIAS purely for call-site continuity (see anthropicProvider.ts:12,
   claudeCodeProvider.ts:13, cliBackendProvider.ts:14). Verified by grep: the
   two loop functions actually defined in THIS file have no other production
   caller left — only brainSearchLoop.test.ts still exercises them directly.
   Do not wrap a provider in both loops (this file's AND assistantToolLoop's)
   — that would run the ReAct round-trip twice.

   What IS still genuinely shared: the primitives below (executeBrainDirective,
   describeBrainDirective, isBrainDirectiveError, stripInvisibleLines,
   recallForDirective, withTimeout, BRAIN_RECALL_TIMEOUT_MS). Real consumers:
   assistantToolLoop.ts (brain-directive execution), managedProvider.ts +
   managedProviderEvents.ts (their OWN separate ReAct loop implementation
   reuses stripInvisibleLines/normalizeQuery/MAX_BRAIN_SEARCH_ROUNDS from here
   rather than sharing a loop — see managedProviderEvents.ts's header for why),
   assistantStore.tsx + agents/runtime.ts (withTimeout/BRAIN_RECALL_TIMEOUT_MS),
   and agentsStore.tsx (recallForDirective, for LazyManager's brain_query
   grounding).

 * Client-side ceiling for a single brain-recall round trip.
 *
 * FLAGSHIP BUG FIX (recall returns 0 neurons): this used to be 8_000ms —
 * well UNDER the backend's own engineered patience window, not over it as
 * the previous doc comment claimed. The Rust side (search.rs) gives the
 * warm sidecar up to `RECALL_WARM_TIMEOUT_SECS` = 30s to answer (sized to
 * clear the engine's documented ~24s worst-case cold embedder load — see
 * that constant's doc comment in commands/brain/search.rs), and the
 * cold-CLI-subprocess fallback it can drop into has its own independent 30s
 * ceiling (`output_with_timeout` in the same file). At 8_000ms, THIS client
 * timeout fired and abandoned the call (surfacing as `brainError`, or —
 * once the fallback's own promise race lost — as an empty recall) well
 * before either backend path could possibly finish a genuinely cold
 * (first-ever, or slow-machine) semantic query: the 30s of backend patience
 * added specifically to survive embedder warm-up was completely
 * neutralized by a 3.75x-shorter client-side giveup.
 *
 * Set comfortably above the WARM-sidecar path's real ceiling (30s + margin
 * for Tauri IPC/serialization overhead) so a normal question actually gets
 * to benefit from that 30s of backend patience instead of being abandoned
 * mid-flight. Does not attempt to cover the rare compound worst case (warm
 * path times out at 30s AND THEN the cold-CLI fallback ALSO takes its own
 * full 30s, ~60s total) — that fallback only triggers when the warm sidecar
 * is unreachable at all (crashed/wrong port), not merely slow, so it is not
 * the common "cold embedder" case this timeout targets; a turn can still
 * time out and degrade gracefully in that rarer case, per this module's
 * "recall must never block the turn" contract.
 *
 * Honest tradeoff: raising this does mean a genuinely first-ever, slow-disk
 * cold load can now make the user wait up to ~150s for brain context before
 * the model starts answering, instead of silently getting no context after
 * 8s. That is the intended fix — a normal question should get real neurons
 * within a reasonable wait, not a fast, wrong "nothing found". Callers that
 * pass an AbortSignal (assistant Stop, mission cancel) still converge early.
 * Progress: recallForDirective / withTimeout never go silent — timeouts surface
 * as describeBrainRecallFailure text, and UI callers may emit interim status.

 * QA3/B17 follow-up: the naive fix suggested shortening the recall budget
 * itself back down (e.g. to 8s) so a stuck chat turn degrades faster. Doing
 * that to BRAIN_RECALL_TIMEOUT_MS would resurrect the exact flagship bug its

 * budget, so the sidecar is already warm — the cold-embedder scenario this
 * module's flagship-bug comment worries about is far less likely to recur
 * seconds later on the same session. Worst case for a chat turn drops from

// nudge contract — see that function's doc comment), yielding typed
// StreamEvents (thinking / tool-call / text) instead of a flattened
// string. Kept as a sibling function rather than having withBrainSearchLoop
// delegate to this one, deliberately: withBrainSearchLoop is exercised by
// every non-assistant AI feature (inline-edit, autoFix, terminalAi,
// AiReview, AiCommitMessage, agents) via claudeCodeProvider/anthropicProvider
// /cliBackendProvider, and those callers never enable brain_search (see
// hasBrainSearchTool) — so keeping its code path 100% untouched by this
// change is the lowest-risk way to guarantee they see zero behavior change.
// Only assistantStore.tsx calls into this function (via each provider's
// streamChatEvents). The small duplication is an explicit, documented
// tradeoff — see the STEP 2 notes in the final report for the reasoning.

 * distinct UI instead of one undifferentiated blob.
 *
 * @param req     Same as withBrainSearchLoop.
 * @param runTurn Same as withBrainSearchLoop — a provider-specific
 *                single-turn text streamer. Still only ever yields plain
 *                strings (the Rust/proxy bridges are unchanged by this
 *                frontend-only feature); this loop is what classifies that
 *                raw text into thinking vs. visible-answer text and detects
 *                the BRAIN_SEARCH directive, exactly like the string
 *                version above.
