/* vaultClient.ts — thin wrapper around the Rust OS-credential-store
   commands (secret_set/secret_get/secret_presence/secret_delete in
   src-tauri/src/commands/vault.rs), plus the one-time migration that moves
   legacy plaintext BYOK API keys out of localStorage and into the vault.

   Desktop (Tauri) only — every export here goes through `invoke`, so it
   only makes sense to call these when `isTauri()` is true. See
   byokProviders.ts for the browser-only localStorage fallback used when
   there is no Tauri IPC (no OS credential vault exists inside a browser
   tab — that fallback is explicit and documented there, not silent).

   Security contract:
   - getSecretRaw returns the RAW secret. Only call it from code that needs
     the actual value to do something with it (e.g. an Authorization
     header for a BYOK provider request). NEVER log its return value.
   - getSecretPresence returns a masked `{ present, hint }` — use this for
     any "is a key configured?" UI check. It never exposes enough of the
     secret to reconstruct it.
