      // "Failed to resolve module specifier" in the packaged app (confirmed via
      // `npm run build` + grep on dist/assets/*.js).
      //
      // This bit every first-party plugin the app dynamic-imports:
      // - plugin-shell (openExternal.ts): caused the "Passer à Pro" button to
      //   silently do nothing (window.open fallback, which WebView2 never
      //   escalates to the system browser). Fixed by calling
      //   @tauri-apps/api/core's invoke('plugin:shell|open', ...) directly
      //   instead of importing the JS wrapper — nothing imports plugin-shell
      //   anymore, so it stays out of this array.
      // - plugin-os (src/i18n/index.tsx), plugin-updater and plugin-process
      //   (src/lib/updater.ts): the identical throw-on-import bug — silently
      //   broke first-run OS-locale detection and made the auto-updater
      //   (check/download/install/relaunch) permanently non-functional in the
      //   packaged app. Fixed by simply removing them from `external` below.
      //   Unlike plugin-shell, no call-site change was needed: these packages
      //   are nothing but thin invoke() wrappers (see node_modules/@tauri-apps/
      //   plugin-{os,updater,process}/dist-js/index.js), so Vite bundles them
      //   cleanly once they're not marked external, and the existing dynamic

      // one genuinely cannot be bundled (an actual Vite build error, not a
